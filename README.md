# Slipwai

**Slipwai creates product repositories and runs a delivery loop in them with coding agents.** Say the name
as "slipway".

```console
$ slipwai install typescript
typescript installed from the slipwai chandlery 1.0.0, published by ROBCOATVG (verified)

$ slipwai generate
Create a new product monorepo. Press Enter to accept a shown default.
Project name: bookings
Use Event Modeling? [Y/n]:
Production target (none/aws/azure/existing) [none]:
Service name [service]: bookings
Bounded contexts bookings holds, comma-separated [bookings]: booking, availability
Frontend (none/react-vite) [react-vite]:

  bookings/ written — 927 files

$ cd bookings && ./init && make verify

verify: all gates passed
```

That is ten minutes. The other five are one feature — specified, modelled, charted, split, built and
demoed in front of you — and they are on the next page.

## What it is for

Coding agents are fast at writing code and bad at everything around it: knowing what to build next, not
treading on each other, and being honest about what they did. Slipwai is the repository around them that
fixes those three.

**One claim holds the rest up.** Two workers, each delivering a slice, and neither waiting on the other's
branch. That works because a **chart** types the contracts between lanes of work and insists each one has
exactly one owner — so a slice is cleared to start the moment the contract it needs is *set*, which happens
at the setting slice's first stage, in its own worktree, before anything merges anywhere.

**Nothing is believed because something said it.** Status is folded from append-only logs every time it is
drawn, and is stored nowhere. A stage that wrote no line made no progress — including a stage that reports
cheerfully that it is nearly done. That rule is the correction of two specific failures: a runner that was
the single source of status and died at iteration two while twenty slices went on merging, and a model file
that said `planned` for eight slices that had shipped.

## The five pages

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **[Start here](docs/guide/start-here.md)** | Install it, answer its questions, watch the gate go green |
| **[Your first feature](docs/guide/first-feature.md)** | A spec, a model, a chart, a slice, and a demo you accept |
| **[A second person joins](docs/guide/a-second-person.md)** | Fairways, berths, and why neither of you is waiting |
| **[Let it sail](docs/guide/let-it-sail.md)** | Captains, the telegraph, and what a person still decides |
| **[Bring an existing codebase](docs/guide/adopt.md)** | The other door: survey, then wrap |

Each one ends where the next begins. Stop when you have what you came for.

## What it looks like running

```
waiting on you: 2
  billing    told    should a refund be its own capability?

berths: 2, 2 working
  fairway   feature  slice   state    last line  tokens  merged  marks
  --------  -------  ------  -------  ---------  ------  ------  -----
  billing   model    BIL-01  working  12s ago    42      0       1
  ordering  model    ORD-02  working  31s ago    84      1       1

telegraph: half-ahead  boilers 3  fanout 2  bunker 126/10000k today
```

`slipwai fleet` for that, `slipwai fleet <stream>` for one lane's own log said a line at a time, and
`slipwai bridge` for the same thing as a page you can answer from. More in
[docs/captures](docs/captures/), which are from real runs rather than drawn.

## Languages, and everything else

The command knows how to build a repository. It does not know any languages — those come from the
**chandlery**, an index of packages with a version, a compatibility range, a checksum and a publisher each.

```sh
slipwai search postgres        # by what a package answers, not by its name
slipwai show python
slipwai install python
```

Six languages are published at `https://robcoatvg.github.io/slipwai-index/`. A publisher you have not met is
confirmed once; the checksum is checked every time, whoever published it. Publishing your own is four verbs
— `slipwai package new`, `check`, `version`, `release` — and a pull request.

### Status

This is slipwai 2, in a fork, under construction. The tree was cleared on 2026-10-06 and is being brought
back in version 2 shape one module at a time; `docs/slipwai-2-plan.md` has the order of work and what is
left. Until 2.0.0 is cut, nothing here maintains 1.x's working contract — there is no `migrate` yet — and
the fork merges back to [ROBCOATVG/slipwai](https://github.com/ROBCOATVG/slipwai) as version 2 once, when
complete.
