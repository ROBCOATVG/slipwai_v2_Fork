# Start here

**Fifteen minutes from nothing to a product repository with one slice demoed.** This page is the first
ten of them: install the command, answer its questions, and watch the gate go green. The next page,
[your first feature](first-feature.md), is the other five.

You need Python 3.10 or newer, Git, and — for a TypeScript or JavaScript project — Node. Nothing else has
to be set up first.

---

## 1. Install the command

```sh
uv tool install slipwai
```

`pipx install slipwai` and `pip install --user slipwai` work too. There is also a standalone executable on
the releases page for a machine with no Python toolchain, which scaffolds with Git alone.

Check it arrived:

```console
$ slipwai --version
slipwai 2.0.0
```

## 2. Get a language

The command itself knows how to scaffold a repository. It does not know TypeScript, or Python, or Go —
those come from the **chandlery**, which is the index of packages it can install from. Look in it:

```console
$ slipwai search
  go            language  1.0.0         available  backends: go
  java          language  1.0.0         available  no description
  java-quarkus  language  1.0.0         available  backends: java-quarkus
  java-spring   language  1.0.0         available  backends: java-spring
  python        language  1.0.0         installed  backends: python
  typescript    language  1.0.0         available  backends: typescript
```

The last column is what each package *answers*, and `slipwai search postgres` searches that rather than the
name — which is usually the search you want: you know you need something that will talk to Postgres for
you, not what it is called.

Install one:

```sh
slipwai install typescript
```

It says where the package came from, which version, who published it, and whether their signature is one
you have trusted. The first time you install from a publisher you have not met you are asked once, and the
answer is remembered; everything after that is silent. The file's checksum is checked against what the
index listed every time, whoever published it.

## 3. Generate the repository

```sh
slipwai generate
```

It asks one question at a time and shows a default for each, so Enter all the way through is a working
project. These are the questions, in the order they come:

```console
$ slipwai generate
Create a new product monorepo. Press Enter to accept a shown default.
Project name: bookings

Delivery foundation:
  event-modelling — Event Modeling — everything above, plus the workflow modelled before it is built
    and delivered one stamped slice at a time, every event a named business fact. Where truth lives is a
    separate question, asked per service…
  standard — Standard — the walking skeleton, the executable test and the CD gate, and no model of the
    workflow behind them. Features are specified one at a time and a service keeps current state…
Use Event Modeling? [Y/n]:

Production target:
  none — Local only — nothing is deployed anywhere; `make verify` is the end of the road
  aws — one ECS service per app, blue/green, RDS Postgres, Cognito, S3 + CloudFront, by OpenTofu
  azure — one Container App per app, PostgreSQL Flexible Server, Entra ID, Static Web Apps
  existing — this project deploys to infrastructure it does not own
Choose (none/aws/azure/existing) [none]:

Language (typescript) [typescript]:
Service name [service]: bookings
What does bookings own? (a sentence or two; Enter to decide later): Taking and changing a reservation.
Bounded contexts bookings holds, comma-separated [bookings]: booking, availability
Frontend (none/react-vite) [react-vite]:
Browser app name [web]:

Write model:
  How a service decides and records a write. Event sourcing is this keel's recommendation and the
  default; answer `state` where a service has earned the exception…

  events — Event-sourced — the log is the truth and state is a fold of it. The recommended answer,
    and the default. Rung 4…
  state — State-stored — the service keeps current state, and its events are the model's contracts,
    raised after each write and never replayed. Rung 2, and the exception rather than the starting
    point…
Choose (events/state) [events]:

Persistence:
  How this service keeps its data. Every answer is one store behind one port…

  memory — In-memory — zero infrastructure, loses all truth on restart…
  postgres — Postgres — the concurrency control the rung names: unique (stream, version) on an
    append-only table where the write model is `events`, a version column checked on save where it is…
Choose (memory/postgres) [postgres]: memory

Internal authentication:
  …
Choose (none/keycloak) [none]:

External authentication:
  …
Choose (none/keycloak) [none]:

Output parent [~/code]:
created: /Users/you/code/bookings
```

A question with nothing to explain is the one-line form — `Language (typescript) [typescript]:`. One where
the answers need describing prints them first and then asks, which is why `Write model`, `Persistence` and
the two authentication questions look different. In a terminal all of them are a list you move through with
the arrow keys; the typed form above is what you get in a pipe, a script, or a terminal that cannot be put
into raw mode.

**Two of these questions are different in kind, and only one of them is hard to undo.** `Use Event
Modeling?` decides whether the workflow is drawn before it is built — whether there is a model at all. It is
worth answering yes to on nearly anything a team will keep working on, including a product whose services
store current state, and you can start modelling later: a model is a design practice, not a storage format.
`Write model` is the storage decision, it is asked per service, and **it is the one that cannot be walked
back.** An event log folds down into tables whenever you decide it should, so a service can stop being
event-sourced; state cannot be turned back into history it never recorded, so "start on `state` and adopt
events later where a subdomain earns it" is an option that mostly does not exist. Every other answer here is
a directory you can regenerate, a service you can add, or an axis you can converge later.

**Press Enter on `Write model`.** Event sourcing is this keel's recommendation, and the default, for two
reasons that are about how the work goes rather than about storage. A slice is independently deliverable
because the log is the contract between slices: a later one reads an event without asking the service that
wrote it, and without the two being planned together. And the system stays changeable after the first
design turns out to be wrong, because a read model nobody thought of is a replay away rather than a
migration. Answer `state` where the service has genuinely earned the exception — a small supporting
domain, a context that honestly is field updates, something whose past nobody will ask about — and write
down why, because the asymmetry runs the other way: you can always stop being event-sourced, and you
cannot start having been.

The two were one question until phase 15: choosing Event Modeling chose the log with it, so a product that
wanted the model over services keeping current state could not be generated, and neither could one with a
context that earned the log beside three that did not. They are two answers now, and `project.json` records
the second per deployable. `slipwai add-service --write-model state` is how a later service answers
differently from the first; left out, it takes the first service's answer.

Everything you were asked is written down in `project.json`, and nothing else keeps a second copy of it:
the Makefile, `docker-compose.yml`, the CI workflow and the gate scripts all read that one file.

## 4. Start the repository

```sh
cd bookings
./init
make verify
```

`./init` installs Spec Kit for whichever coding agent you use, and wires in the skills, commands and agent
types the profile needs. It reaches the network once, here, and never again.

`make verify` is the whole gate — lint, types, tests, the architecture checks, the model and the chart.
It is what CI runs, and it is green on a repository nobody has written a line in yet:

```console
$ make verify

verify: all gates passed
```

**That green is the point of the first ten minutes.** You now have a repository where the gate is a fact
rather than an aspiration, which is the only state from which "keep the main branch releasable" means
anything.

  specs/                one directory per feature: spec, mock-ups, chart, slices
  scripts/              the gates, the agents, the event-model renderer
  skills/ commands/     what the coding agent is given to work with
  project.json          every answer you gave, read by everything above

```

`make help` lists every target with a sentence each. You do not need to read it yet.
