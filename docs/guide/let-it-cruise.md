# Let it cruise

So far you have been in the room for every slice. This page is about not being — a run that keeps going
while you are at lunch, and stops for you when it genuinely needs you rather than at every rung.

The honest summary first: **this does not take you out of the loop, it takes you out of the loop's
middle.** Three things still stop for a person, by design, and they are the three where being wrong is
expensive.

---

## Cast off

```console
$ make cruise
cruise: harbourmaster up (pid 48021), captains: booking (48023), availability (48024)
cruise: nothing here is holding the state of the run — close this terminal if you like
```

That last line is not a pleasantry. The first attempt's runner *was* the state of the run; it died at
iteration two, and the seventeen iterations after it ran from interactive sessions and wrote nothing, so
the checkpoint still said "iteration 2" while twenty slices merged. Nothing here holds anything. Kill
every process and `slipwai fleet` still tells you exactly where the run got to, because it reads the logs.

## The captain

One captain per fairway. Each turn it fetches trunk and both logs, works out its own state from its own
`claimed` and `merged` lines, picks the next slice that clearance allows, writes `claimed`, dispatches
`/sail` in that fairway's berth, and watches the log while it runs.

**It believes the log, not the agent.** A stage that has written nothing for its wall budget is ended and
parked with a reason — not because the agent said it was stuck, which a stuck agent cannot say, but because
the log stopped. That inversion is the whole reason a captain is trustworthy enough to leave alone.

A captain holds no credential and never merges. It asks:

```
2026-10-08T09:14:50Z  asked to merge: merge slice/BOK-01 into trunk after the full gate
```

## The harbourmaster

One per repository. It is the only thing that writes the harbour log, and it does three jobs:

- **Carries marks.** A `mark-set` line in one fairway's deck log becomes a harbour-log line every other
  fairway reads. That is the mechanism behind "nothing merged and the sibling started".
- **Answers requests.** A captain asks; it writes `granted` or `refused`, with the reason. A request that
  was refused and left no line is one a captain waits on for ever and nobody can explain afterwards.
- **Allocates berths.** Up to the number of boilers lit.

## The telegraph: one lever for the whole run

```console
$ slipwai telegraph
telegraph: half-ahead
  boilers           3         berths lit at once
  fanout            2         delegates one captain may have running
  bunker_per_slice  1000      thousands of input tokens one slice may spend
  bunker_per_day    10000     thousands of input tokens the harbour may spend in a day
  stage_scale       1.0       what every stage budget in `stages` is multiplied by
  bar               MEDIUM    the severity at or above which an adversary finding must close before a merge
  decision_ceiling  10        decisions that may stand unread before a fairway parks
  wait_bound        60        minutes any wait may last before it is a parked line with a reason
```

Five positions, fastest first:

| Position | boilers | fanout | per slice | per day | bar | decisions | wait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `full-ahead` | 5 | 3 | 1500k | 20000k | HIGH | 12 | 90m |
| `half-ahead` | 3 | 2 | 1000k | 10000k | MEDIUM | 10 | 60m |
| `slow-ahead` | 2 | 1 | 700k | 5000k | MEDIUM | 5 | 30m |
| `dead-slow` | 1 | 1 | 400k | 2000k | LOW | 3 | 20m |
| `stop` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | LOW | 0 | 0 |

```sh
slipwai telegraph slow-ahead          # every number together
slipwai telegraph --set boilers=4     # one number; the board then says "slow-ahead, adjusted"
```

**Notice that the bar gets *stricter* as the run slows.** That is not arithmetic, it is a judgement: a run
somebody has reached over and slowed down is a run they are already unhappy with, so less gets deferred,
not more. `stop` is the brake — running captains finish the stage they are in and park.

## Saying something to a run that is going

```sh
make cruise-tell MSG="the hold should expire after 15 minutes, not 45"
```

It goes into that fairway's inbox, and the captain reads the inbox **at every boundary** — not just at the
start of a slice. Having read it, it writes a `read` line carrying the timestamp of what it answers, which
is what makes it a receipt rather than an assertion that somebody looked.

`--now` ends the iteration in flight so the message goes immediately, at the cost of the stage's work.

## What still stops for a person

1. **Mock-up approval.** Before the work is typed, every surface state is approved, parked with the question
   it waits on, or marked `n/a` with a reason. A surface nobody has seen becomes a read model, a route and a
   set of tests, and all three cost more to move than a drawing.
2. **The demo.** An actor-visible run of the slice, in front of somebody, and acceptance is recorded against
   a **capability** rather than a slice — because what a person accepts is a chunk of working product, not a
   branch.
3. **Anything the ceiling catches.** When `decision_ceiling` decisions have been taken without a person
   reading them, the fairway parks itself. Not a warning: it stops. A run that takes a hundred unread
   decisions is a run that has quietly become somebody else's product.

Everything else — stage order, budgets, which slice is next, scope, the gates — is enforced rather than
asked about.

## Careen and stow

```sh
make careen     # stop taking new slices, finish what is in flight, and clean up
```

A long run accretes: stale berths, branches whose slices merged, logs worth rotating. `careen` is the
haul-out. **Stow** is the smaller one — a captain stowing its working state at a boundary so the next turn,
possibly in a different process, picks it up from disk rather than from memory it no longer has.

## What this looks like when it is working

![The bridge: what is waiting on a person, the streams, the speed](../captures/bridge.png)

Two streams, one question waiting, the lever at half-ahead, and the run reporting on itself a line at a
time. You answer the top block and leave the rest alone.
