"""The registry as the running process has it: the built-in languages and every package the directory holds.

`registry.registry()` delegates here by name, at call time, so the catalog — which a package's Python imports
through the keel — is built before any package is imported. `catalog.py` read the fragments and merged them
(phase 1); `build` imports each package (phase 2), refuses alone the ones that cannot load, takes a refused
package's backends back out of the catalog, and orders what is left the way the catalog does.

A fault in a built-in language is not a package's to refuse: `load` raises for it and every verb stops. A fault
in a package is one line, `language <name> (<directory>): <fault>`, and the others load.
