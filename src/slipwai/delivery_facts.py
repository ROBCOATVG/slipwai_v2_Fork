"""What the tree says about how a repository is delivered: which forge runs its CI, how a change reaches
production, and what each buildable directory is for.

Three facts brownfield adoption used to assume — a GitHub workflow for every repository, a service in every directory,
nothing about the release path — and the first real adoptions showed each assumption wrong. Read here the way
`survey.py` reads everything else: proposed only from a file that says so, with the file, and None where nothing does,
which the record then carries as `unrecorded` rather than as a default that looks like an answer. `survey.py` calls
these; nothing else does.
