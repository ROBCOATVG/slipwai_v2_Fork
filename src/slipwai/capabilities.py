"""What a project can do, and what that earns it.

A capability is what an answer *gives* a project, named for the thing rather than for the answer that
brought it: `frontend`, `react`, `typescript`, `event-sourcing`, `auth-keycloak`. `catalog.json` declares
them per profile, per frontend and per axis option; `project.json` records them per deployable, and the
union across the deployables is what the whole project can do.

That union is the one question a skill has to be able to ask. `assets/toolkit/skills/` holds the whole
delivery catalogue, and most of it applies to any project — `tdd`, `refactoring`, `specification` — but
some of it is about a capability a given project does not have. `bff-entry-points` is eleven thousand words
about a backend for a frontend, in a project with no browser app; `secure-oauth-oidc` is eleven thousand
more about a login, in a project with no identity provider. A skill says which capabilities it serves in
its `SKILL.md` frontmatter, and a skill that says nothing serves every project.

This is not the same question as *which language a skill's examples are written in*. A language-shaped
skill still ships, with a pseudocode disclaimer (`examples.py`), because the guidance is
language-independent even where the snippet is not. A skill about a capability the project does not have
has no such reading: there is nothing for it to be about.
