"""Where the keel's delivery material lives in a project, and how files assembled for one place go in another.

A generated repository keeps the keel's own material at its root: `Makefile`, `init`, `scripts/`, `skills/`,
`commands/`, `agents/` and `docs/` sit beside `apps/` and `project.json`, and every path the keel writes or names
assumes so. A repository the keel did not make already has a `Makefile`, a `docs/` and a root of its own, and the
method has to be installed *beside* those rather than over them. `project.json`'s `layout.delivery` says where: `.` in
every generated project — nothing moves and not one byte changes — and a directory such as `delivery` where the material
is wrapped around an existing codebase. (That path is brownfield adoption; this key is its first piece.)

Two things follow from a value other than `.`, and both are done here in one pass over the assembled files
rather than threaded through every part that names a path. The *delivery paths* — the seven roots above and
everything under them — are placed under the directory. And the text of every file that is run or read from
the repository's root is re-pointed: a root-relative `scripts/…`, `skills/…`, `commands/…`, `agents/…` or
`docs/…`, and `./init`, gain the prefix, exactly as `toolkit.spoken_for` respells `apps/service` on the way
in. The scripts themselves are left alone: code under `scripts/` finds the root by the nearest `project.json` and its
siblings by its own location, and a literal in it that reads `docs/…` relative to its own tree would be
broken by a prefix, not fixed. Not re-pointed either: a path already inside another (`apps/x/scripts/`, a
URL's `/docs/`), a relative `../docs/` — the trees move whole, so a link inside one stays right — and the
word `Makefile`, which has no runtime meaning in prose. Where a recipe or a workflow has to reach the
Makefile it says `make -f <delivery>/Makefile`, which is `Layout.make`.

`applications` and `packages` are recorded beside `delivery` and are still the constants `apps` and
`packages` everywhere; `scripts/deploy.py` reads the second, and nothing yet reads the first.
