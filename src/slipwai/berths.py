"""Where one captain works, and the allocation policy that stops two of them colliding on one machine.

A berth is the provisioned place a fairway is worked in: a git worktree, a block of ports, a database, a
scratch directory, and a sandbox. In the experiment and in MANDA this was an operator's job and lived in
their head — five berths on one machine, the port numbers chosen by hand, and a load average of 198 when
nobody was counting. What goes wrong is not dramatic: two berths take one port, one of them fails to start,
and the failure reads as a broken service rather than as a collision.

**So the policy is arithmetic, not a table somebody maintains.** A berth's ports are a block derived from
its index, its database is suffixed with its own name, and both fall out of the berth existing. Nobody
chooses a number, so nobody chooses the same number twice.

**A berth holds no credential.** Not for the forge, not for the cloud, not for the chandlery. Anything
needing one goes through the harbourmaster, which holds them and checks each request against what a run
never does. A berth that held a token would be a sandbox with a way out of it.

The provisioning itself — making a worktree, starting a sandbox — is slice 5.14b, and its macOS question is
still a person's: `sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple and undocumented, and the alternative is a container
per berth, which costs a Docker dependency on every laptop. This module is the part that needs no answer to
that: what a berth *is*, and which numbers it gets.
