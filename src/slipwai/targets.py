"""Where a project goes to production, and what that takes off its menus.

A **target** is the place a generated project is deployed to. `none` means local only: `make verify` is the
end of the road. It is asked right after the foundation because it decides the menus that follow — an option
declares the targets it is offered under beside the backends it is implemented for, and the same filter that
keeps `fastify` off a Go project's menu keeps a file-bound store off a cloud one. A backend declares its
targets too, so a target can be limited to the backends that can be built into an image for it.

Three rows ship: `none`, `aws` and `existing`. A target the keel *manages* (`"managed": true`) arrives with its
infrastructure and never before it — a catalog entry with nothing behind it would generate projects claiming a
destination they cannot reach, which is the half-ported shape this factory refuses everywhere else — so `aws` arrived
together with `infra/`, the image builds, the deploy pipeline and the per-target provisioning of the options it carries.
`existing` is the other kind: the project deploys somewhere the keel does not own — a repository the method was
installed around (brownfield adoption) has its infrastructure already, described elsewhere or nowhere — so it offers
what `none` offers, provisions nothing, and turns on the documentation of where it goes and the release-constraint rung
of `/drive` instead. The second cloud is meant to be a fourth row in these same tables, not a second set of branches.

A target may `require` an axis: `aws` deploys an HTTP service, and `/health` is what proves a deploy, so
`--http none` cannot be taken there. The axis's no-infrastructure answer stays *offered* (an absent answer is
offered everywhere, so a menu never comes up empty) and is refused when chosen, naming both ways out.

A target may also `reserve` words a project's name cannot contain. A cloud names what it creates after the
project, and some of its services refuse their own brand inside those names — a Cognito hosted-login domain
is `<project>-<environment>-staff` and rejects any prefix containing `aws`, `amazon` or `cognito`. The name
is checked the moment the target is known, where it is still a choice, rather than partway through an apply
that has already created half a stack in somebody's account.

A cloud does not always refuse a word the same way, so `reserved` is a mapping from *how* to the words
refused that way rather than one flat list. Azure is why: it publishes three classes at once — `microsoft`
and `windows` are refused anywhere inside a name, about forty more (`azure`, `office`, `xbox`, `app_code`,
`web.config`, …) only as whole words, and `login` only at the start — and a list that means one of those
cannot express the other two. The classes are `anywhere` (a substring, which is what `aws`'s three words
always were), `word` (delimited by `.`, `_`, `-` or an end of the name, since those are the separators a
project name may contain) and `prefix`. A target declares the classes it needs and omits the rest.

Where an option is provisioned differently per target, that lives on the option under the target's key —
`postgres` says `"aws": {"provisions": "rds"}` — so the infrastructure generator reads a declaration rather
than a product name, exactly as the traits in `features.py` are read.
