"""The programme for an adopted repository: every improvement the record shows, in order, paced by the strategy.

Brownfield adoption. Three kinds of thing the survey and the platform turn up wanted tracking without three ledgers: the
big issues that are quick wins (`quick_wins.py`), the runtimes and frameworks past their end of life (`platform.py`),
and the longer moves the ladder in `docs/change-strategy.md` names — packaging, runtime, host, data, the tooling an
ecosystem has and the record says is missing. Under the ladder sits its floor: a build that declares its dependencies
and fetches them. An Ant build with its jars committed is below it, and moving that to Maven or Gradle is the one step
no strategy paces differently — first, because nothing above it can be fetched, dated or audited until it is done.
Beside the build sits the other half of the floor: the application proven to start, its run path written in
`survey/running.md` and the command that starts it and proves it answers recorded as `commands.smoke` — before any slice
changes code that was here, because the first adoptions each merged a slice that had stopped the application starting,
and no suite saw it. This module reads them all off the record as one ordered list, each step with its kind and its
*pacing*: a quick win is now whatever the strategy; the platform and the rungs are a big bang per rung under in-place or
a modular monolith, over time — the new home current from day one, the old home only if it stays — under a strangler
fig, recorded but not scheduled under *leave it*, and, while nothing is decided, "decide the strategy first". Written
into `strategy.programme` by `with_recommendation`, rendered on `docs/change-strategy.md` as *The programme*, and
offered by `/drive`'s Convergence stage from the top. Nothing is ticked off by hand: `/survey` derives it again, and a
step the tree shows done is not there any more.
