"""What is installed, and an install, upgrade or removal as one transaction the loader admits before it lands.

The package directory is the record of what is installed: every directory in it that is not hidden, whether
or not the loader admits it, so a refused package can still be upgraded or removed. Everything a command brings is
staged in a hidden `.install-<token>/` beside them, which the loader skips; the staged set is admitted the way the
next start would load it — `language_directory.fault_in`, `catalog_merge.merge`, `loaded.build`, over what stays
installed plus what is staged — and only then is each package renamed into place. A language is therefore whole in
the directory or not there (`contracts/language-index.md`, *How an install lands*).
