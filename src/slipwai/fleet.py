"""The fleet board: every column folded from the logs, and nothing kept anywhere else.

The first attempt had a checkpoint file that was the single source of status. It died at iteration two and
said "iteration 2" while twenty slices merged. MANDA had the same shape fail the other way: `model.yaml`
said `planned` for eight slices that were built and merged, because the field was written at plan time and
never reconciled.

**So the board stores nothing.** Every column is computed from the deck logs and the harbour log each time
it is drawn. A board that can be wrong about what happened is worse than no board, because it is believed.

**A stalled berth is told from a finished one.** They look identical in a status field — neither is writing
anything — and they are the two states it matters most to tell apart. The log tells them apart for free: a
berth whose last line is a `merged` has finished, and one whose last line is anything else and whose
heartbeat is older than the bound has stalled. That is the whole reason `heartbeat` is a line.

**What it does not have, it says it does not have.** A fairway with no lines is `not started`, not `0%`. A
number nobody wrote is `—`, not `0`. Both of those are the same rule as the rest: the board reports the log,
and where the log is silent the board is silent too.
