"""The second closed set: the moments an extension may *refuse* something, and the seven of them.

`hooks.py` is the first set, and its second rule is the reason this file exists: **a hook is never fatal to
the rung.** It is reported and the rung completes, because an extension that could fail a stage is an
extension that can stop a delivery loop it was added to help.

That rule left one thing unbuildable. `codegraph` wants to say *don't grep for that, ask the index* — which
is not a report after the fact, it is an answer to a tool call that has not happened yet. Version 1 reached
it through Claude Code's own `PreToolUse` hook, so it worked on one harness and silently did nothing on the
rest. Widening `hooks` to allow a refusal would have made every hook able to fail a rung, which is the
control plane the rule is there to prevent.

**So a guard is its own kind.** Three differences from a hook, and they are the whole design:

1. **A guard fires before a tool call, not around a rung.** What it can stop is that one call.
2. **A guard may refuse, by exiting 2.** The reason it printed goes back to the agent, which then does
   something else — usually the thing the guard suggested. Every other exit code is a hook's behaviour:
   reported, and the call goes ahead.
3. **The rung completes either way.** A refused tool call is not a failed stage. `hooks.py`'s rule is about
   rungs and it is untouched: no guard can end one.

The shape is the harnesses' own: Claude Code, Codex and Cursor all have a pre-tool event where a non-zero
exit blocks the call and the message reaches the model. This is the keel's name for that, so an extension
declares it once instead of once per harness.

**A guard is agreed to, not installed.** A hook runs where an extension is elected; a guard also refuses
things a person asked for, so election names the guards an extension declares and takes the person's word
once. An extension that declares a guard nobody agreed to fires none — `.slipwai/guards.json` is written
from the agreement, not from the manifest, and like `.slipwai/hooks.json` it is a controlled file.

**Why there are seven and not three.** The set is closed, so widening it is a keel change, and a keel change
to add a point is the cost this file exists to avoid paying twice. The three it opened with were the three
`codegraph` needed. The four added on 2026-10-08 are the *shapes* the three leave out, and each was added
with something firing it rather than on the chance it would be wanted:

- `before-write` is a path about to be written. The captain's own control-file refusal lives here — a gate
  or a Makefile is not edited by an iteration — and it was a verb inside the runner before this, which is
  why it worked on one harness.
- `before-command` is a shell command about to run. It is the same refusal as `before-write` through the
  door `before-write` cannot see: `make verify` rewritten by a `sed` is rewritten all the same.
- `before-fetch` is a URL about to be read. Egress is its own shape — what a guard is handed is a host, not
  a path — and nothing else on this list can hold an opinion about it.
- `before-stop` is a session about to end. Refusing it carries the turn on, which is the cheap recovery for
  a delegate that stopped without finishing; the captain's gate is the dear one, and parks.

Three shapes are deliberately *not* here. There is no point around a rung — that is `hooks.py`, and a guard
there would make every extension able to end a stage. There is no point that can change what a tool call
does, only whether it happens: a guard that could rewrite the call would be a second author of the diff.
And there is no point after a write, because a refusal after the fact is a report, which is a hook.
