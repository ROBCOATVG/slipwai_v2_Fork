"""The other half of the loader: an extension on disk, read from the same directory a language is read from.

An extension is a package the way a language is — a directory, a manifest, and the files the manifest's hooks
name — and it is found in the same place, by the same walk. Only the manifest differs: `language.json` for one,
`extension.json` for the other, which is how a reader and the loader both tell them apart without being told.

**Two halves, because they are read for different reasons.** A language's fragment is merged into the catalog
and its Python is imported to answer the backend protocol; an extension's manifest contributes a catalogue
entry, a set of hooks and a directory of files to copy into a project, and imports nothing into this process.
Sharing one reader would mean one module holding both sets of rules and a `kind` branch in every function.

**What is copied is everything but the manifest.** `init.py`, whatever it calls, whatever it ships beside it:
the keel does not model an extension's internals, so it does not get to decide which of its files matter. The
manifest is left behind because the project is not where it is read.

**A refused extension is refused alone.** Same rule as a language's: one line naming the extension, its
directory and the fault, and the others load — an extension is optional dev tooling, and a project that cannot
be generated because something optional is malformed has the dependency backwards.
