"""The telegraph: one lever a person rings, and the nine numbers it sets.

A run has a dozen numbers that all mean the same thing in different units — how many berths are lit, how many
delegates each captain may have, what a slice may spend, what a day may spend, how long a stage may take.
Changing "go slower" from one to another is eight edits, and anybody doing it in a hurry gets some of them.

**So there are five positions, and each is a whole set of numbers.** `full-ahead`, `half-ahead`,
`slow-ahead`, `dead-slow`, `stop`, in that order, which is also the order they are stepped down in. A person
rings a position; every number moves together.

**The numbers stay individually settable, because the positions will be wrong.** `--set boilers=2` changes
one and the fleet board then says `half-ahead, adjusted` — adjusted, not a new position, because a board that
reported a position the numbers do not match is a board that is lying. Ringing a position again resets
everything, which is what makes a hurried adjustment safe to make.

**Banking the fires is the same lever, pulled by the clock instead of a person.** When the day's bunker is
spent the harbourmaster steps the position down one notch at a time, writing `fires-banked` with what it
stepped to and why. One notch at a time, and not straight to `stop`: a run that stops dead at the end of the
day loses whatever was in flight, and a run that slows keeps finishing what it started.

`stop` is not a crash. Every captain parks at its *next boundary*, which is the thing a captain was built to
have: a place where ending costs nothing and the log says exactly where it got to.

In the experiment none of these numbers existed. 104 hours and hundreds of millions of input tokens on one
slice, and the only signals were a person noticing and the bill arriving. Both are late.
