"""Cutting a package's release: the entry assembled, the number written, the fragments gone.

A package carries its own `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `changelog.d/`, and the conformance suite holds
the three together: a released `VERSION` must have an entry under that number and no fragments left over.
That rule exists because a version with no entry is a number nobody can find out the meaning of, and a
fragment left behind is a change that will be told to somebody twice.

Until now nothing gave a publisher a way to satisfy it. `VERSION` was a file to edit by hand, and editing
it by hand is exactly what the suite catches — which is how the first six packages were released and how
their first CI run failed. The keel has had `make release` since 8.1 doing precisely this for itself; this
is the same thing, for a package, through a verb.

**Cutting and building are different actions, and stay apart.** This rewrites the working tree: a person
runs it, reads the entry, commits and tags. `package release` builds a tarball from whatever the tree says
and is what CI runs from the tag — and a CI job that rewrote the changelog would be rewriting the commit
the tag already points at.
