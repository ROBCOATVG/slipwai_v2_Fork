"""`slipwai package new`: a language or an extension package that loads on the first try.

Both kinds of package are a directory, a manifest and some files, and both have a shape the loader refuses
for reasons a publisher cannot guess from the outside — a `core` range, a module name derived from the
package's own, a `LANGUAGE` the fragment has to agree with, an entry point meeting six obligations. Version 1
had no scaffold for either, and every package anyone wrote started as a copy of one that already worked,
carrying whatever was wrong with it.

**So the keel writes the skeleton, and the skeleton is one the keel loads.** What `package new` emits passes
`extension check` or installs as a language the moment it is written, with the parts a publisher has to fill
marked `TODO` rather than left out. A scaffold that does not load is a scaffold whose first lesson is that
the tool is broken.

**The manifest is written from this keel's schema, not from a constant.** A package scaffolded today declares
the range this copy speaks, so it is current by construction and nobody has to know what to put there.
