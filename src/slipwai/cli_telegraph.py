"""`slipwai telegraph`: ringing the harbour's one lever, and setting a single number under it.

Three shapes, and the third is the one that matters. `slipwai telegraph` shows where it is. `slipwai
telegraph <position>` rings it, which sets every number together. `slipwai telegraph --set boilers=2`
changes one and leaves the rest, and the board then says `half-ahead, adjusted` — because a board reporting
a position the numbers do not match is a board that is lying.

`delegate` and `cycle` belong to `/sail` and are mirrored here, so a person sets every width in one place;
`--set` writes them back to `.specify/sail.json`, where `/sail` reads them. The telegraph never rings them,
because they are not the harbour's to decide.
