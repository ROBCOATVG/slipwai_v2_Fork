"""Which packages `language install` places, and in what order: the plan `language_install` carries out.

A request is a local source when it is spelled as a path (it holds a `/`, ends in `.tar.gz`, or is `.`), and a
language's name otherwise, so `install go` never means a directory called `go` in the working directory. A framework
(a package whose `name` is not its `family`) brings its family; a family that names `default_framework` brings that
framework; families are placed before their frameworks (`contracts/language-index.md`, *What a verb resolves*).
