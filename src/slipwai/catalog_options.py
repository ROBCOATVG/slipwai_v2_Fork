"""What a language package may add to the catalogue, and what it may not.

The keel declares the axes and the answers that are infrastructure: a Postgres event store is Postgres
whichever language talks to it, and Keycloak is Keycloak. An answer named after a library — `fastapi`,
`spring-web`, `fastify` — is not infrastructure, it is a language's framework, and a keel that declared
one would be a keel a new language has to be edited into. Those belong to the package that implements
them, and this is where a package's `axes` block is folded in.

Everything about an option travels with it: its label, its capabilities, the feature that owns its
files, which targets it is offered under, whether it puts the app into Compose, and what it owns at the
repository root and inside a browser app. The keel's copy of the pruner carries none of it, and a
generated project's copy carries exactly the options that project was offered.
