**What changed, in a sentence somebody installing this would recognise.** Then a paragraph: what it does

```

The first line is the level this change claims — `PATCH`, `MINOR` or `MAJOR`. The entry's level is the
highest any fragment claims, so a release carrying a fix and a new option is a MINOR and not both.

The conformance suite holds `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md` and this directory together: a released version has
an entry under its number and no fragments left over. That is why cutting a release is a command and not
an edit.
