"""`project.json`: the manifest — every answer this project was given, written once for everything that reads it.

Split from `readme.py`, which had reached its budget, and kept apart from `manifest.py`: that module reads a
written manifest back for `add-service` and `replay`, and this one writes it, so the shape is spelled in
two places on purpose — a factory that means something else by these fields is refused by the reader, not
silently accepted by the writer.

    beside three that do not, and the catalogue forbade saying so until `write-model` became an axis. A
    service of the standard profile was never asked, and the axis's `absent` answers for it — `state`.

    and the slice allowed to record one is `adopt --confirm <name> --write-model events`, with `confirmed`
    provenance (15.9). Until then this says the thing that is true of a wrapped application whatever is

    """`project.json`: the answers this project was generated from, for a tool rather than a reader.

    `deployables` is the list of applications everything else reads — the Makefile, Compose, CI, the import
    gate and the pruner are generated from it or read it, and `add-service` appends to it. Each service
    carries its own language, framework and selection; there is no project-wide backend, because a project
    may have several. `schema` says which shape those readers expect; see `services.py`.

    `generator` is provenance, not configuration — nothing generated reads it: `generatedWith` created this
    repository and never changes, `updatedWith` is the newest to have written a file here (`add-service`
    moves it forward), and against the keel's `CHANGELOG.md` the pair says what it has yet to hear.
    `speckitSource` is the Spec Kit `./init` installs — a pinned release, so a rerun that restores the
    gitignored projections reinstalls the same version; `slipwai migrate` moves it as a visible diff.

    `eventSourced` is per deployable because the rung is per service (`sourced`), which is the whole of
    phase 15: `modelled` — is there a model? — is the profile and is project-wide, and `sourced` — is the
    log the truth? — is this service's answer to the `write-model` axis.

    `adoption` is how the repository came to have this material: None for a generated one; for one the method
    was installed around, `"origin": "adopted"` after the generator and its facts after the layout, with its
    applications recorded `"generated": false`, claiming no capability and event-sourced in nobody's eyes.
    `layout` is where things live: `applications` and `packages` as constants (`scripts/deploy.py` reads the
    second), and
    `delivery`, where the keel's own material sits — `.` here, and a directory such as `delivery` where
    the method was installed beside an existing codebase (`layout.py`)."""
