"""What each service runs for the eight targets the Makefile is built from, merged into one recipe per target.

Which command installs, lints, tests or audits a service is its backend's `native_commands` answer, declared
in its language's `project/languages/<language>_toolchain.py` and read through the registry: pure data, the
same command whatever else the selection contains, and the same for every service, spelled for the service's
own path. This module assembles the answers. It sits apart from `makefile.py` for the reason
the service layouts sat apart from `backing_services.py`, and `makefile.py` had grown past check-structure's
module budget saying exactly that.

`TARGETS` is the contract: every backend answers exactly these eight, `docs/backend-obligations.md` documents
them row for row, and `tests/test_backend_obligations.py` fails, naming the backend and the target, until a
new backend answers each one. The contract is owed *per service*: `native_commands` asks it of every service
in the project and merges the answers into one recipe per target.
