"""`harbour.json`: the numbers a run is held to, in the project rather than in anybody's head.

The experiment spent 104 hours and, at its worst, hundreds of millions of input tokens on one slice, with
nothing anywhere saying what too much was. A stage that has no budget cannot be over one, so the only
signals were a person noticing and the bill arriving. Both are late.

So every bounded thing a run does gets a number here: how long a stage may take and what it may spend, how
severe a finding has to be before it stops a merge, how many decisions may go unreviewed, and how long any
wait may last. They are in the project, versioned with it and visible in a diff, because a number in a
prompt is a number nobody can find afterwards and a number in somebody's head is not a number.

**What happens at a budget is stowing, not stopping.** A stage that runs out writes what is left into the
fairway's careen and goes on, and the slice merges. The exceptions are the two that would be dishonest: work
above the severity bar parks for a person instead, and nothing CRITICAL is ever stowed. That ordering is the
whole point — the first attempt's alternative was carrying gaps into the next slice, where a slice that
inherits one pays for it without having chosen to.

**These are defaults, and defaults are the thing most likely to be wrong.** They are written where a person
can change them for exactly that reason. Slice 7.3 adds the telegraph on top: named positions that set
several of these at once, so a person rings `half-ahead` rather than editing six numbers. The numbers stay
individually settable underneath it, which is the point of them being a file.

Every stage has one, in `{CONFIG}`: wall-clock minutes and thousands of input tokens. A stage that reaches
either does **not** keep going, and does not quietly hand its leftovers to the next slice. It stows.

1. **Write what is left into the fairway's careen** — `fairways/<name>/careen.md`, one row per item, each
   saying what is wrong and what closing it would take, with `budget` as the row's *From*.
2. **Append a `stowed` line** to the deck log naming the stage, the slice and how many items.
3. **Go on.** The slice continues to its next rung and may merge. Stowed work is the careen's, and the
   careen is a slice that fairway runs before its flag is hoisted.

Two exceptions, and they are the ones where stowing would be dishonest:

- **Anything at or above the severity bar parks for a person** instead of being stowed. The bar is
  `{CONFIG}`'s `bar`, and the point of a bar is that what is above it does not get deferred by a clock.
- **Nothing CRITICAL is ever stowed**, whatever the budget said. Data of one actor reaching another, or an
  actor gaining a role, is the next slice.

**Say the number, not just that it was reached.** The `stowed` line and the careen rows record what the
budget was and what was spent, because a budget that is hit every time is a budget that is wrong, and
nobody can see that from the word *stowed* alone.

In the experiment no stage had a budget, so no stage was ever over one: 104 hours and hundreds of millions
of input tokens on a single slice, with the only signals a person noticing and the bill arriving.
