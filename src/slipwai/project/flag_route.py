"""`/api/flags`: how a browser app learns what this environment's flags are set to.

A browser cannot read this environment. Vite inlines a `VITE_`-prefixed value while the bundle is *built*,
so a flag compiled into a bundle is a property of that build and not of the environment it runs in — which
is why a flag the browser read used to move only when the environment was deployed again, while the same
flag reached the service in a restart. Two clocks for one flag, and an ordering rule to keep them from
contradicting each other.

The service already holds the answer, and `Source.snapshot()` is it. So the service serves it, the bundle
asks, and the two halves of one flag finally move together.

Under `/api` because that is the service's product surface: `vite.config.ts` forwards `/api` with the prefix
intact, and CloudFront's `/api/*` behaviour has no `origin_path` and no rewrite function, so the path is the
same in both places. `/health` stays outside it, being a probe rather than something a browser calls.

Nothing here is emitted under `--target none`, for the reason the reader is not: a project with nowhere to
declare a flag would get an endpoint that always answered `{}`, which reads as a capability it does not have.
The transports differ in how they arrive at that. Fastify, FastAPI and net/http take the source as an
argument to the app they already build — so their shell is unconditional, declares the source's shape
structurally rather than importing it, and simply never registers the route when nothing is passed; only the
entry point that constructs the app differs, through the two placeholders below. Quarkus and Spring discover
a resource class on the classpath, so for them the route *is* a file, and not emitting it is the whole of the
conditional.
