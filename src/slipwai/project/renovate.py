"""`renovate.json`: what keeps this project's exact pins from becoming old exact pins.

Every dependency a generated project has is pinned exactly — a version, never a range — which is the right
default and has one consequence nobody chose: nothing moves them. A pinned tree is a tree that silently ages
until a security advisory or a broken build forces a jump of several majors at once, which is the expensive
kind of upgrade.

This is the configuration that turns that into a weekly pull request. Three things about it are worth reading
before changing it:

**It is written for this repository's actual layout, not for a default one.** Renovate finds a root
`package.json` and its workspaces, each service's `pyproject.toml` and the `uv.lock` beside it, `pom.xml` and
`go.mod` by itself — the Python half through the `pep621` manager, which reads both the runtime list and the
development group and re-locks with uv. Gitea Actions workflows are read by the same `github-actions` manager
GitHub's are, because they are the same file format in the same directory.

**The toolchain moves in one pull request or not at all.** A Node major is written in `.nvmrc`, in the CI
workflow's `setup-node` input and in the Compose image; a CPython minor in `.python-version` and in
`setup-python`. Renovate reads the pin files natively and the workflow inputs through a custom manager
declared here, because no manager reads an action's *inputs* — without it, Renovate would raise `.nvmrc` to
the next major and leave CI installing the old one, which is precisely the split `.nvmrc` was added to close.
Both are grouped under one name so they arrive together.

**A major waits to be asked for.** Minor and patch updates are grouped per ecosystem and open on their own; a
major lands on the dependency dashboard with a checkbox instead, because a major in a pinned tree is a piece
of work rather than a bump. Vulnerability fixes ignore the schedule entirely.

None of it does anything on its own. Renovate is a bot, and it has to be *running*: on GitHub that is the
Renovate app installed on the repository, and on a Gitea or Forgejo forge it is a self-hosted run —
`renovate` as a scheduled workflow on the forge's own runner, or a cron job — with a token that may open pull
requests. Until one of those exists this file is documentation of an intent. `docs/whats-included.md` says so
where a reader of the project will meet it.
