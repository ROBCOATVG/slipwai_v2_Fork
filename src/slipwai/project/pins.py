"""The toolchain versions this project is pinned to, written where each ecosystem's own tools look for them.

CI and Compose already pinned a Node major and a CPython minor; a laptop was told nothing. So the gate ran on
24 and the person running `npm test` ran on whatever their shell had last selected, and the difference showed
up as a failure in CI that did not reproduce. These files are how each ecosystem spells "this repository wants
that version", and every one of them is *derived* from the constant the CI workflow and the image build
already read (`backends.NODE_MAJOR`, `backends.PYTHON_VERSION`) — a pin file with a number typed into it
would be a second copy of a version, which is a version already wrong somewhere.

**`.nvmrc`, not `.node-version`.** Both are one line holding a version, and the question is only which more
tools read. `.nvmrc` is read by nvm, fnm, asdf, mise and Volta, and is what `actions/setup-node`'s
`node-version-file` is documented against; `.node-version` is read by nodenv, fnm, asdf and mise, but not by
nvm or Volta — the two with the largest installed base. So `.nvmrc` is the file a contributor's existing
tooling is likeliest to already honour, and it is also the one this keel's own `survey.py` reads first when
it is looking at somebody else's repository.

Only two languages take a file of their own, because only two need one. Go pins its toolchain in `go.mod`'s
own `go` directive — which is why the CI step reads `go-version-file: <service>/go.mod` rather than a number —
and Java pins its build through the committed Maven wrapper and the `java-version` its CI step names. Adding
a `.go-version` or a `.java-version` beside those would be a second answer to a question already answered, and
the first thing to drift.

`.editorconfig` is written whole rather than per language present, and that is deliberate. It describes how a
file of a given type is written, not what this project contains, so a section for a language the project has
no files in costs nothing and is right the moment `add-service` adds one — whereas a conditional
`.editorconfig` would be a file every later command had to remember to regenerate. Every generated project
also has `scripts/*.py` and YAML workflows whatever its services are written in.
