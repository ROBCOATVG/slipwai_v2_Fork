"""`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: build once, push by digest, apply staging, smoke, apply production, smoke.
`.github/workflows/production.yml`: started by hand, promote what staging is running.
`.github/workflows/rollback.yml`: started by hand, `make rollback` in the environment named, then smoke.

Only under a production target. The deploy starts when `verify` has passed on `main`, not when the push
lands: it is a `workflow_run` of `verify.yml`, so the two cannot run side by side and a commit the gate
failed is never applied. Every job checks out the commit that run verified (`workflow_run.head_sha`) rather
than whatever `main` points at by the time the job starts, and `scripts/deploy.py` reads the commit from the
checkout, so the images it resolves are that commit's.

The build job installs each language family's toolchain the way `verify.yml` does, plus whatever image
builder the families need. Every job becomes the deploy role one of two ways: on GitHub with the
repository's short-lived OIDC token and no stored credential; on a forge without OIDC federation (Gitea)
with the access key or client secret `make bootstrap` stored as a repository secret. The deploy jobs run
the same `make deploy` a person would, in order, each proved by `make smoke` before the next begins; they
need nothing from the build job, because `scripts/deploy.py` resolves the commit's images from the registry
by tag.

The production job is the one part of that a project can decline. `make bootstrap` asks whether to
auto-promote to production and writes the answer to the forge as `AUTO_PROMOTE`; that job runs unless it
reads `false` — the test is `!=` rather than `==` so a repository generated before this existed, which has
no such variable, keeps deploying production exactly as it did. Without auto-promotion, staging still
deploys on every green push and production waits for `production.yml`:
started by hand or by `make promote`, it resolves the commit staging is running, checks *that* out, and
deploys it. So production is only ever given images staging has already run, whichever way it is reached,
and no laptop ever applies it.
