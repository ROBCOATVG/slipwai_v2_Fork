"""`infra/`, `scripts/deploy.py` and the ADR: what a project going to a production target is given.

Only the `aws` target has any of this; under `none` the module contributes nothing, which is the whole
difference between the two. The HCL is copied from `assets/targets/aws/` as committed — the bootstrap stack,
the service stack, the environments' tfvars — and what the *project* decides is written beside it as data:
`project.auto.tfvars.json`, one map of the services with each answer translated into what the target provisions
for it (`store = "rds"`, `auth = "cognito"`), how each service's migrations run once it is an image, and the
environment its backend needs in production. The stack reads that map with `for_each`, so `add-service` is a
change to the data and never to the HCL.

The feature-owned parts of the stack — the database, the two user pools — sit inside `backing-service:<feature>`
marker comments in the HCL, exactly as they do in docker-compose.yml, so the same prune that drops an answer
locally drops its infrastructure too. The parts that depend on a browser app existing (the bucket and the
distribution in front of it) are chosen by file rather than marked: a frontend is not a feature.

      backends). Gated on there being something to migrate at all.
    - The **store**, for the client half of a managed Postgres's TLS policy (the backend's

      `None` included — a backend whose driver ignores `PGSSLMODE` is told nothing rather than told
