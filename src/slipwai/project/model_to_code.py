"""The document that says what each box on the model becomes in a file.

Its own module because it is most of the bytes and none of the behaviour: `event_model.py` computes the
per-backend paths and this renders them, which is the same split the service layouts were on the other side
of. One page, generated per project, because the paths in it are the project's own.

    """`docs/event-modeling-to-code.md`, with this project's backend and its first service's paths."""
    return f"""# From event model to code

The model describes behavior; the `{backend}` services under `apps/` make it executable. The paths below
name the first service, `{service}`; a slice that belongs to another service lives under that service's
directory in the same shape. Which service that is, is the slice's `service` field in `model.yaml`, decided
against what each service says it owns — the `purpose` on its `project.json` entry, listed under *Bounded
contexts* in `docs/architecture.md`. With one service the field is optional; with two or more,
`make check-model` requires it, because a slice that names no owner lands in the first service by
gravity, not by decision. `<context>` in the paths is the slice's `context` where the service holds
several bounded contexts (its `contexts` in `project.json`; the gate requires the field then too), and the
service's one context otherwise. Names are illustrative—domain names come from modelling.

| Model element | Code responsibility | Initial location |
|---|---|---|
| `ui` | actor-facing surface plus driving adapter | application-specific surface under `{service}` |
| `cmd` | typed intent and application use case | `{paths['usecase']}` |
| `evt` | immutable, versioned fact | `{paths['events']}` |
| `rmo` | pure fold, plus the store its slice's `materialisation` names | application module, plus a driven adapter for anything but `live` |
| `pcr` | processor that reads, decides, and issues a command | `{paths['usecase']}` |
| `stream` | aggregate identity and optimistic-concurrency boundary | domain identity plus event-store port |
| `guard` | the other boundary: a tag query and the position it was read at, which `appendIf` is refused by | the project's tagging function, plus the conditional append at the use case |
| `evt`'s `attributes` | the payload's fields; the ones marked `identifies:` become the event's tags | the event, plus the tagging function the store is built with |

Keep decision logic pure: rehydrate state by folding events, decide from state plus a command, and return
new events or an explicit rejection. The application layer loads history, invokes the decision, and appends
with an expected version. Infrastructure implements ports; it does not enter domain code.

A read model is a pure fold in all three cases, and `materialisation` on the slice says what maintains it:
`live` folds it per query and stores nothing, `inline` writes it in the append's own transaction, `async`
maintains it from a catch-up subscription whose checkpoint advances in the same transaction as the view.
`make check-model` requires the field from `planned` for the same reason it requires a guard — the event
store ships with `read`, `append` and a replay from position zero and nothing else, so a per-query fold is
the only read path that is already there, and a slice never asked ships with every query paying for the
whole log. A `live` view names `liveBudget` too: the ceiling one query may fold, and why that ceiling holds
in terms of the stream's own lifetime.

## Testing by responsibility

- Express agreed examples as observable tests using `{paths['test']}`.
- Test pure decision tables directly only for meaningful combinatorial rules.
- Run every port contract against both its fake and real adapter.
- Test driven integrations against realistic stubs for parsing, timeout, retry, and error translation.
- Test delivery adapters for parsing and outcome mapping; do not duplicate domain rules there.
- Keep Python tests on pytest, Go tests on `testing`, and TypeScript tests on Vitest—the repository gate
  already invokes the canonical stack.

Event names, payloads, stream identity, `reads`, `folds`, tests, and code paths change as one contract. Use
`/validate-code-against-model` to report drift rather than silently changing either side.
