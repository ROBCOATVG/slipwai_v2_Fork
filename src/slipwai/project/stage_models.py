"""`.specify/models.json`: which model runs each stage of `/drive`'s ladder, by role — and the section of
`commands/drive.md` that applies it.

Every stage ran on whatever model the harness happened to be set to, at the same price for gauging whether a
slice converged as for turning `examples.md` into tests. The table puts the choice in the project,
versioned with it, keyed by the command each stage runs: `strong` where a stage decides what to build or
whether it was built, `fast` where the input is already fully specified on paper, `review` where a slice's
whole diff is read by someone who did not write it. Roles rather than model names, because identifiers are
provider-specific and go stale; they are mapped under `roles`, per harness, in the one place the project
owner edits. The split is a hypothesis until benchmarking measures it, which is why every stage says out
loud which model ran it.

`host` is a value, not an absence: the model running `/drive` itself, with no delegation. `strong` and
`review` both map to it, since a strong host handing its judgement away is as often a downgrade as not.
`fast` is seeded only where the identifier is verified — Claude Code's Agent tool takes `sonnet` as an alias
— and is `null` on every other harness that can switch, which `scripts/agents/models.py` reports as "no
identifier mapped" rather than pretending. A harness the registry records no mechanism for gets no row.
