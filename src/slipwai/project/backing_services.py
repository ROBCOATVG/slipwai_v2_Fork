Split in two by where the files land: `backing_service_files` owns the repository root — Compose, the
environment template, the prune script, the Keycloak realms — and `backing_service_service_files` owns
`apps/service`, the ports and adapters themselves with the contract suites that keep them honest.

The prose that explains all of it — the README sections and what each gate proves — is
`backing_service_prose.py`, split out when this module outgrew its budget.
