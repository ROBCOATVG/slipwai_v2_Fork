```mermaid
{runs}
```

There is no load balancer per service and none to pay for: the Container Apps environment answers on a name
of its own with a certificate of its own, and a container app declares the ingress it wants. A deploy is a
revision — the new one starts beside the one serving, takes no requests until its readiness probe passes,
and then takes all of them at once. `kept_revisions` decides whether the release before goes on running: one
in production, so a rollback is a change of traffic weight, and none in staging.{site_note}

## How a commit gets there

```mermaid
{path}
```

`deploy.yml` starts when `verify` has passed on `main`, never beside it. Migrations run before the new
revision rolls, so the release still serving keeps the schema it knows; `make check-migrations` holds every
migration to expand/contract for the same reason.{note} `make deploy ENV=…` from a laptop with credentials
runs the same code path.

## Context

`{project_name}` was generated with `--target azure`. The pipeline is feature zero: the first commit already
carries a build, a deploy target and a rollback, so credentials, permissions, DNS and monitoring are found out
on day one rather than under deadline pressure. Everything below was decided once, in the factory, for every
project that chooses this target; what this project owns is `infra/`, and every one of these rows is one
file there.

## Decision

| Question | Answer |

{table}

## What it costs while idle

Roughly ${idle} a month per environment: about $6 per service for a 0.25 vCPU replica at the idle rate,
{"about $16 for the database" if database else "and no database"}, {"$9 for the site, " if web else ""}$5 for
the registry across the whole project, and a few dollars of logs. Ingress, the certificate and the address
are the platform's and cost nothing, which is the line that is not here: the AWS target pays about $18 a
month per service for a load balancer, so this one is cheaper at one service and further ahead at three.
Two environments, twice that, less the registry. Nothing here scales to zero in production, on purpose — a
production service that sleeps is the wrong trade — but `min_replicas = 0` in `staging.tfvars` is a real
saving on the environment where a cold start costs nobody anything.

Which is why production is a project's own decision to make on the day it wants one. With `AUTO_PROMOTE` set
off — `make bootstrap AUTO_PROMOTE=false`, or the question `./init` reaches — nothing is applied but
staging, and the bill is the one environment until `make promote` creates the other. It is a saving in the
days before production exists and not a penny after: once promoted, production costs what the table above
says whichever mode this project is in.

## Consequences

- Deploys are the pipeline's. `make deploy ENV=…` exists so a person can run the same code path, not so
  that production is applied from a laptop; `infra/README.md` says what the pipeline is configured with.
- Without auto-promotion a person is back between staging and production, which the decision above
  argued against. What that buys is a project that pays for one environment until it wants two, and a
  promotion that is still the pipeline's own `make deploy` on the runner with the deploy identity. What it
  costs is that "every green commit is in production" stops being true, and nothing here checks that a
  promotion ever happens — production silently ages behind staging until somebody looks.
- `make bootstrap` is run once by a person signed in as an Owner of the subscription, and its state
  committed. Owner rather than Contributor because it grants the pipeline its roles, and granting access is
  not something Contributor may do. On GitHub everything after that is a repository variable and the
  pipeline holds no credential; on a forge without OIDC federation the pipeline holds one client secret.
- Active CPU on Container Apps bills at several times the idle rate, so a saturated replica costs more than
  the figure above — around $20 a month rather than $6. It still does not lose to a Fargate task, because
  that task needs its own load balancer beside it whatever it is doing; the crossover is at sizes where a
  project has moved off the Consumption profile anyway, and that is the day to re-price this table.
- `make ci` builds every image and proves it starts, listens and answers its probe locally
  (`make smoke-image`) — a 503 from a readiness probe counts there, because nothing else is running; the apply
  itself cannot be proved without a subscription, so `tofu validate` is what the gate holds the stacks to.
- `min_replicas` is one. Two in production is what makes a deploy — and a lost availability zone —
  invisible, at another $6 a month per service; raise it in `production.tfvars` when the product is in
  front of people.
- Migrations run before the new revision starts, and every migration is held to expand/contract by
  `make check-migrations`, because a rollback keeps the schema the newer revision left.
- A revision suffix must be unique for the lifetime of a container app, and `make rollback` re-runs a
  commit that has already had one. So the suffix is the platform's hash of the template rather than the
  commit, and a rollback is an ordinary apply rather than a name collision nobody would hit until the
  second time they rolled back. Which commit a revision runs is the image tag on it.
