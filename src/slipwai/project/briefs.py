"""The standing brief each agent type carries, read from `assets/toolkit/agents/` instead of written in Python.

Three quarters of `src/slipwai/project/` is English inside string literals, and the 350-line budget therefore
cuts a module wherever the prose happens to reach it rather than where the code has a seam: `cruise_agents.py`
held the skipper's, the hand's and the bosun's briefs only because `agents.py` had reached its budget, and no
reader looking for the bosun's words would guess to open a file named for the cruise. A brief is prose a person
edits a paragraph at a time, so it belongs where the rest of the toolkit's prose already is — one `.md` per
type, beside `skills/` and `commands/` — and what stays here is the part that is not prose: which file belongs
to which type, and the closed set of values a brief is allowed to name.

The frontmatter of a brief carries its `description` and nothing else. `name`, `stage`, `writes` and
`commands` are generated from `stage_models.STAGES`, because they are the scope a harness enforces: a file
that hand-wrote `writes: none` could disagree with the table that projects the same stage into every other
harness, and the harness would then enforce the wrong thing. A brief that names one of those four is refused
rather than merged, so the drift cannot start.

Nothing under `assets/` was templated before this — every asset is copied byte for byte — and that is the
reason the substitution below is a closed set rather than `str.format`. `format` would read every `{` in a
brief as a field, which makes a shell `${VAR}` or a JSON example an escaping question a person writing prose
should never have to think about, and it answers a misspelt name with a `KeyError` from the middle of a
generation instead of a line saying which file named what. The doubled-brace marker is the one the toolkit
already uses for language examples (`examples.py`), so a brief's placeholders look like every other
placeholder under `assets/`.

A brief is also copied into a generated project unresolved, by the same loop that copies every toolkit file,
and then written over by the resolved one at the same path — the arrangement `toolkit.py` describes for
`docs/first-slice.md`, where `scaffold` lets the generated text win by construction rather than keeping a
second list of which assets are also generated. That is why this directory holds exactly one file per type
and nothing else: a shared preamble or a note to whoever edits these would be copied in like the rest and
written over by nothing, so it would ship with its `{{make}}` still in it.
