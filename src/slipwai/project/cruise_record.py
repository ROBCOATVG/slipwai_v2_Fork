"""The two records a run writes in a fixed shape: a decision, and a demo.

Their shapes live here, apart from the command that shows them and the brief that repeats them, because
three things are written from them — `commands/cruise.md`, the owner brief, and the `check-decisions` gate's
expectations — and a shape stated once cannot drift between them.

**There were three.** The checkpoint — `specs/cruise-checkpoint.md`, rewritten at every stage boundary so a
compacted context could resume — went with the runner in 7.7d, along with the stop file, the pid, the feed,
the stream, the watch cursor and the two inbox files. Each of those was state held outside the logs by the
one process that held the run, which is exactly what could not survive that process dying or a second machine
joining. What a compacted context reads now is the deck log, which is written anyway because it is what the
captain reads, and so is never stale and costs the stage nothing extra.

**A decision that outlives its slice is also an ADR.** Ask the `architecture-decisions` skill's one question
of every entry, host-decided or skipper-decided: would reversing it cost a migration rather than a refactor —
an event's schema or name, stream identity, tenancy, the store, personal data, identity, a new dependency, a
published contract? Where it would, write `docs/adr/NNNN-<title>.md` in Nygard's five sections at `Proposed` —
the run never accepts its own architecture decision — with the next unused number, allocated here the way
`D<n>` is, and name it in the entry's `Written to` beside the artifact. The entry is the log of what was
decided; the ADR is where the next slice looks for why, and `{REPORT}` lists every ADR still `Proposed`."""
