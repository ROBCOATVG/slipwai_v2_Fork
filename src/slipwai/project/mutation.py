"""What `make mutation` does per backend, and why — the prose the generated Makefile carries, and the command.

Read only by the two modules that build the Makefile and the one that writes `commands/mutation.md`. The answers
are the backends' own (`mutation_note`, `mutation_tool`), and they are per backend rather than per family where
that is load-bearing: `make mutation` is run by no gate in a generated project, and by the keel's only for Go
(docs/backend-obligations.md section 2), so a note is most of what stands between the next reader and a score
they should not trust — and the two Java backends genuinely disagree, because PIT works under Spring Boot's test
harness and times out under Quarkus's. Each language's `mutation_note` answer holds its note.

# Mutation

Read `skills/mutation-testing/SKILL.md`. Target changed production code and use {" or ".join(dict.fromkeys(answer(b, MUTATION_TOOL) for b in backends)) or "the ecosystem's mutation tool"} when the
project has configured it. Mutation tooling is intentionally not part of the mandatory repository gate: if it
is absent, report the exact setup decision needed instead of pretending mutations ran. Classify survivors,
add tests only for meaningful behavioural gaps, then finish with `make verify`.

## It is a gate, not a report

A slice merges at its threshold or it does not merge. In the first attempt the score was a number in a
report and the gaps moved on: 18 from S08 to S09, 31 from S09 to S13, 46 from S12 to S13, until two whole
slices existed only to collect the debt. A slice that inherits a gap pays for it without having chosen to,
and the slice that made it has already been accepted.

So nothing is carried. A survivor is one of three things, said out loud and in this order: a behavioural
gap, which is a test written now; an equivalent mutant, which is recorded as one with its reason; or a
decision that this code does not warrant the test, which goes to the fairway's careen as a stowed row with
the slice that stowed it. What is not available is a fourth answer where the number is noted and the slice
merges anyway.

A run that cannot happen at all — no tooling configured — is the setup decision above, reported as a stop
rather than passed as a score. A gate that is green because it did not run is the one failure mode worse
than a red one.
