# Where `{project_name}` stands

A generated project starts at the top of every ladder below and the method keeps it there. This repository
started wherever it was; this page says where that is, axis by axis, and the loop climbs one rung per slice
until nothing here differs from a generated project — at which point `slipwai converge` makes it one. **{at}** of
{len(rows)} axes are at their target, **{below}** below it, **{unrecorded}** unrecorded.{ended}

Every row is a fact `project.json` holds under `convergence`, with where it came from: `detected` from the tree,
`confirmed` or `overridden` by a person, `unrecorded` where nothing has said. Nothing is a default. To move a
row, establish the rung — a slice, a decision, a pinned seam — then say so in `project.json`; `/survey`
(`slipwai adopt --refresh`) re-reads the tree and regenerates this page, and `{layout.make} check-convergence`
fails a row the tree contradicts or a page that no longer matches the record. `/sail` reads this before the
first slice and offers the next unplanned row as a method slice beside the product's.
