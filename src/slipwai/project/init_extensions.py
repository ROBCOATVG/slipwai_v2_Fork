"""The extension half of `./init`: the menu that offers them, and the shell that elects and runs them.

Split out of `init_script.py` when the guard offer arrived and that module reached its budget — which is
what the budget is for. The two halves are a real seam rather than a convenient one: everything here is
about *optional dev tooling a person chooses*, and what is left there is about the bootstrap every project
gets whether or not anybody chooses anything.

Two answers are taken here and they are deliberately separate. **Electing** an extension installs it and
runs its hooks, which are never fatal to a rung. **Agreeing** to its guards lets it refuse a tool call, so
`--offer` asks once, over `/dev/tty`, and silence is no.

# The `init` point, fired through the registry like every other point — which is what slice 6.1e closed.
# Until then this loop ran a file called `init.py` by name, so an extension that declared a different script
# at that point was ignored: installed, valid, and silently never run, which is the convention-not-
# declaration failure `hooks.py` opens by describing. The registry is written first now, from
# `available.json`, and `hooks.py init` fires whatever each elected extension declared there — `init.py` by
# default, because that is the one file an extension is guaranteed to have (`hooks.DEFAULTS`).
#
# Never fatal to the rest of `./init`: Spec Kit and the agent projection are already in place by here, and
# `hooks.py` exits 0 whatever a hook did, reporting a failure as a `hook` line naming the extension and the
# last thing it printed. A key nothing shipped is one of those lines rather than a stopped bootstrap.
# `SLIPWAI_INTEGRATION` carries the harness chosen on this run to a hook that adds to `skills/` and has to
# re-project it: Spec Kit records the integration for later runs, but a hook running inside the same
# `./init` cannot rely on that record being there yet.
#
# Before the agent projection, the extensions already adopted here are re-projected: one that names its MCP
# server in each installed harness's project file has another file to write when a harness is added later
# (`./init --integration <agent>` on a project that adopted it earlier), and Spec Kit has recorded the new
# harness by this point. As non-fatal as everything below.
#
# Then one more projection pass, because that order has a cost: an extension points the agent at itself by
# appending to `AGENTS.md`, and a harness whose `contextMode` is `copy` reads a file Spec Kit wrote from
# `AGENTS.md` before any of this ran. Without the pass its copy never gains the pointer, and the extension
# is installed but never queried. `--context` carries only the marker-fenced regions across — and writes the
# `@AGENTS.md` include an `import` harness reads the whole file through — as non-fatal as the hooks above.

# The user site is tried first, and fails on purpose under PEP 668 (Homebrew's and Debian's Python refuse
# pip outside a venv); then a venv under `.delivery-tools/` that sees the system's packages, which the person
# puts first on PATH — `python3` is what the scripts call, so nothing here can be pointed at it any other way.
# Never fatal: Spec Kit is installed by now, and this is a message with the fix in it rather than a failed
# bootstrap. `.delivery-tools/` is already gitignored for the event-model check's own `--target` installs.
