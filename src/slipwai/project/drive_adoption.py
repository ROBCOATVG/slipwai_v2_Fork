"""The adoption phases of `/drive`: what the ladder gains in a repository the method was installed around.

Brownfield adoption is a phase of the delivery loop rather than a step before it. A generated project starts at the top
of every ladder on the convergence map; an adopted one starts wherever it is, and the loop's job is to climb, one rung
per slice, until the two are the same thing. So `/drive` in an adopted repository has three more things to do, and they
are stages so that the "enter at the first incomplete stage" rule reaches them: **Ground** before Principles — no map,
no principles, and an unrecorded row on an axis the slice touches is a question before anything else; **Pin** before
Implementation — code that was here is changed only once `/characterise` has recorded what it does at the seam; and
Convergence re-checks the map after the slice, flips the row a rung was reached on, and offers the next unplanned row as
a method slice. The hooks in `.specify/extensions.yml` say the same three things to whoever typed a `/speckit-*` command
without ever typing `/drive`.

   the rows and name the ones this slice touches — a slice through {wrapped_paths(apps) or 'a wrapped application'}

   what a strategy is about, and a strategy the map only *recommends* is a question, never a default; a slice
   that changes how a change reaches production touches *Path to production*. A row whose provenance is
   `unrecorded` — or `detected`, the tree's reading and nobody's answer — on an axis the slice touches is a
   question for the person **before anything else**: the release path first of all, since a slice with no
   known path to production cannot be called releasable. **Asking is this stage's work, not a stop:** run
   `/ground` here, inside `/drive`, for the axes the slice touches — or with no argument, the first time, for
   every row a person has not placed — one row at a time, the evidence and the rungs shown first, each answer
   written where the record keeps it (`release`, `ci`, a deployable's `kind`, `why`, or the `convergence` row
   itself, provenance `confirmed`), then `/survey` so the record is followed. The stage is done when the rows
   the slice touches are `confirmed` or `overridden`, or the person has said they cannot place them; a row
   nobody can answer today stays as it is and is said so in the slice's specification — never filled in from context
   — and an ADR's `Accepted` is the person's word, never yours. Then continue down the ladder in the same run."""

   that pin it and the command that runs them. Otherwise run `/characterise <behaviour>` for each, one at a
   time — it refuses "everything", and so does this stage. Code the factory generated needs no pin: its
   tests are the pin. A slice that touches no code that was here passes this stage by saying so, and a slice
   that reaches a seam nothing can observe deterministically records the smallest seam it introduced in the
   same ledger. What stands in at the seam is a fake written in the test tree, never a mocking framework this
   stage would have to add — `/characterise` says why. This is the *pinned* rung of the safety-net axis,
   held per slice rather than claimed once. **And before any pin, the application has to start.** Where
   `{running}` still reads *Not yet proven* for the application the slice changes, or its record in
   `project.json` has no `smoke` command, this stage refuses the slice and says so: proving the run path and
   recording `smoke` is the programme's step right after the build, and it goes first — the one exception is
   the slice that proves it. A suite that never builds the context cannot see a constructor the container
   cannot call, and slices have shipped that way, converged and green, with an application that no longer

   the change in place: `make smoke` where a `smoke` command is recorded, the command `{layout.under('survey/running.md')}`
   holds otherwise, and a converged verdict that rests on the suite alone is not one. A runtime or a
   framework that moved a major version moves on the Platform row, as a slice of its own and never inside
   another — `/survey` reports a version that moved without the row planning it as a disagreement, and the
   slice that moved it is not converged until the row, or an ADR, owns the move. Then, because this repository is converging on what a generated one has, hold
   the map to what the slice did: run `make check-convergence` and read `{MAP}` against the diff. A rung this
   slice reached — a quarantined suite now green, a role now recorded, a release script now run by CI on
   every commit — flips its row: edit that row in `project.json`'s `convergence` (`rung`, `evidence` naming
   what established it, `provenance` `confirmed`, `planned` cleared), run `/survey` so the page follows, and
   `make ratchet-tighten` where fewer findings remain than the baseline records. A rung the slice did not
   reach stays where it is; the map is never moved to match a hope, and `make verify` fails a row the tree
   contradicts. Then offer the next slice. **An open `CRITICAL` in `specs/<feature>/adversary-log.md` comes
   first**, ahead of every product and method slice, until it is fixed or a person has deferred it in that row
   with their name and reason: one adoption pinned a defect that leaked one customer's account to another as a
   failing-if-fixed test and then spent a slice on an icon. Then the next method slice,
   from the programme `{layout.under('docs/change-strategy.md')}` carries (*The programme*), top first: a quick win — a secret in the tree the same day — then a build below the
   floor (Ant with its jars committed, to Maven or Gradle: first whatever the strategy), then an application
   nobody has proved starts (its run path written and `smoke` recorded: before any slice changes code that was
   here), then a product out of
   support, then a rung of the ladder or a tool the ecosystem has and nothing here runs, each paced as the
   decided strategy says; and, with the programme empty, the lowest map row still below its target with nothing
   `planned`. What is offered is written into the row's `planned` (or the step's evidence named in the slice) and
   handed to `/story-splitting` as a method slice for the split to place among the product slices — never ahead
   of all of them by default, a secret and an open `CRITICAL` excepted. A step that needs a decision nobody has
   made (a release path,
   a change strategy — the programme says *decide it first*) is offered as the question, not as work;
   `/survey` derives the programme again, so a step done is gone rather than ticked. Demo feedback that is
   neither a thing an actor does nor a rung of the map — an icon, a colour, a label — is a task in the next
   slice, never a slice with acceptance criteria of its own."""
