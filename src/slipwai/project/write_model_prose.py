"""The paragraphs of the generated pages that change with the rung a service is on.

A service's write model is how it decides and records a write: `events`, where the log is the truth and
state is a fold of it, or `state`, where the service keeps current state and the events the model names are
contracts raised after the write and never replayed. Phase 15 made that an axis answered per service, and
`metadata.sourced` is the one place that reads it. This module is the other half of the same claim — what
the pages then say — because until now they said it off the profile, which answers *is there a model?* and
was being read as *is there a log?*. A product with one context that earned the log beside three that did
not could not be generated, so no page ever had to describe one.

Here rather than inline in each page for two reasons. The first is that the rung is a single claim — what a
write locks, what it leaves behind, and whether any of it may be folded back — and every page that carries
its own copy is a copy that can drift: the README would go on promising a replay long after `AGENTS.md` had
stopped. The second is budget, which is the shape of the first: `guidance.py` sat three lines under
check-structure's module budget and `readme.py` sat exactly on it, so a sentence that now has two endings
had nowhere to grow in either of them.

The section it writes into `docs/architecture.md` is called *The write model* and was called *Backend event
bundle*, because the bundle is the thing phase 15 took apart: Event Modeling and event sourcing were
selected together and the heading said so.

Nothing here decides a rung. `sourced` does, and these functions ask it, so a service the keel did not make
and a browser app are on the one side of every sentence below without this module knowing why.

Event Modeling covers the end-to-end product journey, and it covers it the same way whichever service a
slice lands in. What differs per service is the write model — how a write is decided and what it leaves
behind — which `project.json` records as `eventSourced` on each deployable:

{bullets}
Events are immutable facts on either rung; never invent or rename one merely to unblock implementation, and
never raise one claiming something the service did not record at the time. The rung itself is the one answer
about a service that cannot be walked back once it holds data: state can be turned into a log from the day
somebody decides, but not backwards into history it never kept.{boundary}
