"""`docs/deployment.md` and `docs/adr/0002-production-target.md` for a project going to **AWS**.

Beside `infra.py` rather than inside it, because these two answer a different question. That module decides
which files a project going to production is given; these decide what a reader is told about them — one
Mermaid drawing of what the answers provision and how a commit reaches it, and one decision record whose
rows carry the cost. Both are generated from the same answers the stacks read, so `add-service` and
`add-frontend` regenerate them with everything else and neither can describe a project that no longer
exists.

One module per target, named for it, because there is nothing general here to share: the nodes are ECS
services and target groups, the rows are Fargate and RDS and Cognito, and the costs are this account's.
`target_docs.py` is the table that picks between them, and a second cloud is a row in it beside a module of
its own — never a branch inside these two functions. What *is* shared is in `provisioning.py`.

Generated with the project and regenerated by `add-service` and `add-frontend`, so it draws what `infra/`
provisions for *this* project's services rather than the target in general. `staging` and `production` are
the same shape, each with its own cluster, load balancers, database and user pools; the names below are
production's. Whether production exists yet is the `AUTO_PROMOTE` variable on the forge: `true` deploys it
on every green push, `false` leaves it to `make promote` and to nothing else. [`docs/adr/0002-production-target.md`](adr/0002-production-target.md) is why each part is
what it is, and what it costs.

## What runs

```mermaid
{runs}
```

Every service has its own load balancer and CloudFront distribution: with no domain there is nothing to
route by host, and the balancer speaks HTTP because a certificate needs one — CloudFront is what gives the
HTTPS address `make url` prints. Blue/green is ECS's own: a release's tasks register with the target group
that has no traffic, pass their health checks there, take all of it at once, and the previous release stays
up for the bake time, so a rollback in that window is the listener rule pointing back.

| Service | Backend | Image | Port | Store | Staff identity | Users |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
{table}

## How a commit gets there

```mermaid
{path}
```

`deploy.yml` starts when `verify` has passed on `main`, never beside it. Migrations run before the new
revision rolls, so the release still serving keeps the schema it knows; `make check-migrations` holds every
migration to expand/contract for the same reason.{note} `make deploy ENV=…` from a laptop with credentials
runs the same code path.

It is not a live re-read, and where that is what a flag needs, `flag_transport = \"appconfig\"` in that environment's tfvars is the other shape: an AWS AppConfig agent beside the container, read over loopback, and a flip that takes effect in seconds with no restart at all.

Date: generated with the project. Status: accepted at generation; amend it here when a row changes.

## Context

`{project_name}` was generated with `--target aws`. The pipeline is feature zero: the first commit already
carries a build, a deploy target and a rollback, so credentials, permissions, DNS and monitoring are found out
on day one rather than under deadline pressure. Everything below was decided once, in the factory, for every
project that chooses this target; what this project owns is `infra/`, and every one of these rows is one
file there.

## Decision

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
{table}

## What it costs while idle

Roughly ${idle} a month: about $9 per service for the smallest Fargate task and about $18 for its load
balancer, {"about $12 for the database after the first free year" if rds else "and no database"}; Cognito and
CloudFront sit inside their free tiers at this scale. Two environments, twice that; a second task per service
in production, another $9. Nothing here scales to zero, on purpose — a production service that sleeps is the
wrong trade.

Which is why production is a project's own decision to make on the day it wants one. With `AUTO_PROMOTE` set
off — `make bootstrap AUTO_PROMOTE=false`, or the question `./init` reaches — nothing is applied but
staging, and the bill is the one environment until `make promote` creates the other. It is a saving in the
days before production exists and not a penny after: once promoted, production costs what the table above
says whichever mode this project is in.

## Consequences

- Deploys are the pipeline's. `make deploy ENV=…` exists so a person can run the same code path, not so
  that production is applied from a laptop; `infra/README.md` says what the pipeline is configured with.
- Without auto-promotion a person is back between staging and production, which the decision above
  argued against. What that buys is a project that pays for one environment until it wants two, and a
  promotion that is still the pipeline's own `make deploy` on the runner with the deploy role. What it
  costs is that "every green commit is in production" stops being true, and nothing here checks that a
  promotion ever happens — production silently ages behind staging until somebody looks.
- `make bootstrap` is run once by a person with administrator credentials and its state committed. On
  GitHub everything after that is a repository variable and the pipeline holds no credential; on a forge
  without OIDC federation the pipeline holds a key whose only permission is to assume the deploy role.
- `make ci` builds every image and proves it starts, listens and answers its probe locally
  (`make smoke-image`) — a 503 from a readiness probe counts there, because nothing else is running; the apply itself
  cannot be proved without an account, so `tofu validate` is what the gate holds the stacks to.
- `min_tasks` is one. Two in production is what makes a deploy — and a lost availability zone — invisible,
  at another $9 a month per service; raise it in `production.tfvars` when the product is in front of people.
- A deploy runs both revisions for the bake time, so the deploy job takes that much longer in production and
  the environment briefly costs double. Migrations run before the new revision starts, and every migration
  is held to expand/contract by `make check-migrations`, because the two revisions share the database and a
  rollback keeps the schema the newer one left.
- The provider re-sends the service's load-balancer block on every update, which would make every deploy
  land on the same target group (hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws #45678); `ignore_changes` on that block
  and on the listener rule's action is the workaround, so a change to either is a `tofu taint`, not an edit.
