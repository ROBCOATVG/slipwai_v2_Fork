"""`commands/drive.md`'s ladder: the rungs, in order, and which stage of the model table runs each.

The ladder is the shape of the loop section 5 of the plan draws, and it lives apart from the page it is
written into because it is the part that keeps changing: slice 5.8 adds the review rung, 5.9 the careen's
stowing, 5.12 how dark a merge is, and 5.17 moves the example map onto both profiles. A rung is named by
`stage_models.STAGES`, never here, so a stage with no rung and a rung with no stage are both refusals
rather than a page and a table that quietly disagree.

Version 1 stopped the ladder at the demo and left what came after it to prose further down the page. Three
things that decide whether a slice may merge were in that prose — the adversary pass, the mutation gate,
and the merge itself — and prose is read once where a numbered rung is walked every time. They are rungs
here, and the prose they came from stays where it is, saying how each one is run.
