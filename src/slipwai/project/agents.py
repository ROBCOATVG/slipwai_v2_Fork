"""`agents/`: one named agent type per stage `/drive` sends to a fresh context.

Every delegation the toolkit made was an anonymous general-purpose agent handed a prose brief, and the write
scope was a sentence inside it — "remain read-only", "may edit only the files its task requires". Nothing but
the delegate's reading of that sentence kept an adversary from patching what it found, which is the
anti-pattern `skills/adversarial-testing/SKILL.md` lists first. Five of the six harnesses that can give a
sub-task its own model can only do it through a file, and the same file is where that harness says what the
delegate may touch. So the constraint belongs in the file, where the harness enforces it, and the per-call
brief is left carrying only what is actually per-call: the task, the contract and the manifest.

These are the canonical types, one per delegable stage in `stage_models.STAGES`, named for the stage so the
model resolves through `.specify/models.json` with no second lookup and `/model-delegation-settings` stays the only place a
model is chosen. `scripts/agents/project.py` renders each into the installed harness's own agent file —
Codex's sandbox mode, Cursor's `readonly`, Copilot's and Gemini's tool lists, opencode's permissions, Claude
Code's `disallowedTools` — resolving the model at projection time, and says in the stamp where a harness
could not express a declaration rather than letting the gap pass for enforcement.

What this module holds is the projection and nothing else. The words of each standing brief are assets under
`assets/toolkit/agents/`, read by `briefs.py`: prose a person edits belongs where the skills and the commands
are, and a module that carried eleven briefs had to be split at a paragraph boundary to stay inside its
budget. The scope does not follow them. `name`, `stage`, `writes` and `commands` are generated here from the
stage table, because they are what a harness is held to, and a brief that wrote its own would be a second
answer the projection could pick up instead.

## What holds for every delegate here

Read [{SAFETY}]({SAFETY}) before you touch anything: it carries the
constraints that hold for every delegated agent in this repository — preserving the checkout, leaving
long-lived processes alone, never sending a state-changing request to a running application, never altering
branches, commits, tags, remotes or credentials. This file is the standing part of your brief and that page
is the standing part of this file; the per-call brief adds only the task, its contract and the file manifest.

Where this project has adopted a code index, a question about a symbol — what calls it, where it is used, what
a change would break — goes to the index first, by whichever route its own block in `AGENTS.md` names: a command
through the shell, which works in every session, or a tool where yours lists it. Name the route that answered.
Text search is for words in documents — `spec.md`, `decisions.md`, the PRD, `model.yaml`, a test's string — and
finding a file by name is a `find`, not a question for the index. An index that ships a guard refuses a symbol
search of the source until you have asked it, and a run's log counts which delegate did.

`writes: {agent.writes}` and `commands: {agent.commands}` above are the scope, and the projection of this file
into your harness enforces as much of it as that harness can express — the stamp on the projection says what
it could not. Where the harness could not, the words still bind: treat the scope literally, and stop and
report rather than reaching past it. A delegate that meets a product decision, or needs a file its manifest
does not name, hands the question back to the session that delegated it. It does not choose, and it does not
search outward for permission.
