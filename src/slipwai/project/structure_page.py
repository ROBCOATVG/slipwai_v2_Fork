"""`survey/structure.md`: the architecture view, rendered for the two decisions that need it.

The Structure axis of the convergence map climbs `as-found` → `named` → `laid-out` → `hexagonal` → `typed`, and
`/strangle` has to choose a seam; both want to know where anything starts, what depends on what and where change
happens. `structure.py` reads that; this page says it, per wrapped application, and ends with what the reading
means for the map and for the cut. Written by `adopt`, rewritten by `adopt --refresh`; never edited by hand.

each rung asks of this repository:

{ladder}

The Platform row stands at `{platform.get('rung', 'unknown')}` ({platform.get('provenance', 'unrecorded')};
{platform.get('evidence', 'no evidence recorded')}). It climbs `unknown` → `inventoried` → `supported` → `audited`
as *What it runs on* above is dated, brought into support product by product — each an option above, offered as a
method slice, never a version the factory bumps — and given an `audit` command the gate runs. `/survey` reads every
product against the table on the day it runs, so a runtime that leaves support while the work goes on moves this row
by itself — and re-dates the reading only when a product, a version, a status or the table moved, so the date above
is the day something last changed and not the day somebody last looked.

A rung is claimed only once the fact behind it holds; `make check-convergence` fails a row the tree contradicts.

move and the first to pin (`/characterise`, `{layout.under('survey/pinned.md')}`). The hotspots are where the next
change lands anyway, so a seam there pays for itself; a capability nothing has touched in the whole window is a
candidate to leave where it is (`docs/change-strategy.md`).
