"""The prose that explains the selected adapters: the README sections and what each gate proves.

It sits apart from `backing_services.py` for the reason the service layouts once did — the tables are most of
the bytes and none of the behaviour, and a module holding both outgrows what anybody wants to read at once.
`backing_services.py` had grown past check-structure's module budget saying exactly that.

The split is also where the readers are. Nothing here writes a file: `project/readme.py` asks for the
README section and `project/docs.py` for the gate section, while the half left behind is read by
`scaffold.py` and the per-language modules. Every table is keyed by the feature that answered an axis
rather than tested for by name, so a second event store or a second identity provider is a row and not a
branch.

### Postgres — the event store

```sh
make services-up       # start Postgres and wait for it to accept connections
make migrate           # apply the event-store migrations
make test-integration  # the event-store contract against real Postgres, plus a genuine race
```

The in-memory and file-backed stores cannot race, so they cannot prove that two concurrent appends at the
same version produce exactly one winner. That proof lives in `make test-integration`, and it is the reason
to choose Postgres. Demo on memory, ship on Postgres.

A schema change is two migrations in two deployments: first the additive one (a new table, a nullable
column, a column with a default), which the release already running can live with; then, once nothing
reads or writes the old shape, the one that removes it. The second names the first in a comment line —
`-- contract: 202609151030_orders_add_status` — and `make check-migrations` refuses a drop, rename, type change or
new NOT NULL column that is unmarked, or whose expand arrives in the same change. Rolling back a release
never rolls back the schema; this is what makes that safe. A new migration is named by a timestamp,
`202609151030_orders_add_status.sql` (`date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M`), so two slices built at once never mint the same
name; the shipped ones are numbered, and every stamp sorts after every number, so the order is lexical either way.

### SQLite — the event store

A real append-only log in one file, with nothing to start and nothing to migrate: the schema ships with the
adapter, because an embedded database is created by the process that opens it. `make verify` runs the shared
event-store contract against it, so the guarantees it does hold are proved on every commit.

What it does not hold: **SQLite serialises writers**, so it cannot prove concurrent behaviour — it never
genuinely races. It proves durability and it proves the log refuses to be rewritten. If the
never-write-the-same-version-twice guarantee matters to your product, move to Postgres and prove it there.

`scripts/backing-services.py --list` shows what each axis can still be answered with in this project, and

added back this way. The answer goes into `project.json` in the same run, so `slipwai migrate` will not
offer the dropped adapter back, and `make check-agents` names the skills it was justifying:
