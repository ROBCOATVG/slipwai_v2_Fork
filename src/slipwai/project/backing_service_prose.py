"""The prose that explains the selected adapters: the README sections and what each gate proves.

It sits apart from `backing_services.py` for the reason the service layouts once did — the tables are most of
the bytes and none of the behaviour, and a module holding both outgrows what anybody wants to read at once.
`backing_services.py` had grown past check-structure's module budget saying exactly that.

The split is also where the readers are. Nothing here writes a file: `project/readme.py` asks for the
README section and `project/docs.py` for the gate section, while the half left behind is read by
`scaffold.py` and the per-language modules. Every table is keyed by the feature that answered an axis
rather than tested for by name, so a second event store or a second identity provider is a row and not a
branch.

column, a column with a default), which the release already running can live with; then, once nothing
reads or writes the old shape, the one that removes it. The second names the first in a comment line —
`-- contract: 202609151030_orders_add_status` — and `make check-migrations` refuses a drop, rename, type change or
new NOT NULL column that is unmarked, or whose expand arrives in the same change. Rolling back a release
never rolls back the schema; this is what makes that safe. A new migration is named by a timestamp,
`202609151030_orders_add_status.sql` (`date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M`), so two slices built at once never mint the same
name; the shipped ones are numbered, and every stamp sorts after every number, so the order is lexical either way."""
