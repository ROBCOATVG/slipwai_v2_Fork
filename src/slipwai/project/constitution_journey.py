"""The constitution as a journey: the profile's constitution template, adapted to where an adopted repository stands.

A generated project ratifies the whole floor on day one, because it starts at the top of every ladder. A repository the
method was installed around (brownfield adoption) does not, and a constitution that says "trunk MUST be releasable at
every commit" over a repository on long-lived branches is a fiction the gate would then hold. So the template an adopted
repository drafts from is the profile's own with a difference: each principle whose axis on the convergence map stands
below the rung it comes into force at is written as **a target, not yet in force** — the rung this repository stands on,
the rung the principle needs, what holds here today (a placeholder only this repository can fill), and the principle as
it will read when in force, kept as a quotation. A marker names the rung, so `check-constitution` can hold the
constitution to the map: a marker at another rung is drift, and a principle claimed in force while the map says
otherwise is the fiction this exists to prevent. When a row reaches its rung, the marker comes out, the quotation
becomes the text, and the check asks for the principle in full.

`JOURNEY` is the table the gate script carries too (`assets/toolkit/scripts/check-constitution.py`); a test
holds the two copies equal.
