    """Claude Code's own moments, each pointed at the one script that answers them: `session.py`.

    Every row here is a *point of a closed set* — `guards.py`'s or `hooks.py`'s — and not a behaviour of its
    own. That is the whole of what changed in 7.7b. These rows used to name `cruise.py <verb>`, so the
    control-file refusal and the compaction protocol were things the keel wrote into one harness's settings
    file: they worked on Claude Code and silently nowhere else, which is the failure the two closed sets
    exist to end. `session.py` runs the keel's own answer and then whatever an extension declared at that
    point, so an extension says `before-write` once and gets it wherever a harness has such an event.

    `PreToolUse` runs before a tool call and a command exiting 2 refuses it, the stderr becoming the result
    the model reads. `Stop` runs when the model tries to end its turn and can refuse that too. `PreCompact`
    runs just before compaction, and `SessionStart` with the `compact` matcher when the session continues
    after it, its stdout added to the context. The other harnesses' equivalents, where one exists, are the
    registry's `hooks` rows, and `scripts/agents/project.py` writes those hook files from the same verbs.

    # there, and the hook failed silently rather than doing its job. The scripts already find the root from

# What the delivery loop runs in every project whatever its language: the toolkit's own scripts — the captain,
# the harbourmaster, the fleet, the projections, the gates — and the Git a slice is made of. A session that
# cannot ask is refused every command its rules do not name, and one refused first command parks a run before
# its first stage: a TypeScript project's first run could not call a single toolkit script, its allowlist
# having no `python3` rule. The headless session is now given the shell wholesale by the
# registry's row (`--allowedTools Bash`), because no list can name the compound commands an agent writes; these
# rules are what keep a person's own session from prompting at every hook and gate, and the deny rules below
# are what hold in both. Resets and cleans are absent, and a plain force-push is denied rather than merely
# unlisted, because `git push *` would otherwise admit it: they destroy work.
# `git push *` itself has to stay, because the ladder's own push after a rebase is the lease-guarded one,
# `git push --force-with-lease=refs/heads/slice/<id>: origin HEAD:...`, which a narrower prefix could not name.
