"""Where the chandlery is, how its document is fetched, and the release a verb installs from it.

The index is a tree of files under a base URL, found the way `slipwai upgrade` finds its own (`upgrade.index_of`):
`SLIPWAI_INDEX`, else the uv receipt's index, else a documented default. Its document,
`<base>/slipwai-languages/index.json`, lists each release with its file, the file's `sha256` and the release's own
manifest, so a verb can say which releases speak this keel, which family a framework needs and which framework
a family brings without fetching one (`contracts/language-index.md`).

What a document *says* is `index_schema.py`'s; this is how it is reached. The split is the one every network
client wants: a shape that can be tested without a server, and a fetch that can be tested without a shape.

An index that cannot be read is `Unreachable`, said with its URL and the reason, and never an empty list: a project
maker is not told "nothing available" when the truth is "could not ask". Nothing is published at the default
yet, so until a person publishes there every verb that needs it says so.
