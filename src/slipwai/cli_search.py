"""`slipwai search` and `slipwai show`: browsing the chandlery from the command line.

A person who wants a language has to find out it exists before they can install it, and version 1 had
no way to ask: `list` says what is installed and what the index happens to offer, in one shape, with no
way to narrow it. These two are the answer to "what is there?" and "what is this one?".

Both read the same index `install` reads, so what `search` shows is what `install` would fetch. Neither
needs a package installed, and neither installs anything.

Every line says whether a package is installed, because the first thing a reader does with a search
result is work out whether they already have it.
