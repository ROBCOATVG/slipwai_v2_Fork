"""Putting an extension in the package directory, and taking it out again.

A language's install is a transaction over a merge: the staged packages are admitted the way the next start
would load them — fragments read, catalog merged, registry built — because one language can make another's
backend key, axis option or family unloadable, and a directory where that is only discovered at the next
start is a directory that generates nothing.

**An extension collides with nothing but its own name.** It adds a catalogue entry and a directory of files;
it declares no backend, answers no axis and imports nothing into this process. So the admission is the
manifest being readable and the name being free, and the transaction is a stage and a rename rather than a
whole second load.

**Four kinds of source, all of them a directory in the end.** A name, which is looked up in the chandlery and
fetched; a path to a package directory; a path to a release file; or a git URL, which is cloned into a
temporary directory and read as the first kind. The clone is shallow and its `.git` is dropped on the way in:
what is installed is the package, not its history, and a package directory that is also a working checkout is
one `slipwai extension upgrade` would fight with.

**A name is the form a search result hands you.** `slipwai search` prints a name and `slipwai extension
install <name>` takes it, which is the one thing version 1's languages got right and that an extension had no
way to do at all — the three it shipped were in the keel, so nobody ever had to find one.

**Nothing is installed half-way.** Staged under a hidden name the loader skips, admitted, then renamed into
place. An interrupted install leaves a hidden directory and nothing else, which the next install clears.
