"""`slipwai fleet` and `slipwai fleet watch`: the board, drawn from the logs each time it is asked for.

What a person wants from a board is one answer: *is anything waiting on me, and is anything stuck?* So those
two are at the top and everything else is under them. The berth table is what is running; the inbox is what
is waiting on a person; the feed is the last lines of both logs, which is where a reader goes when a row
does not say enough.

`watch` redraws on an interval. Not a daemon and not a subscription: it folds the logs again, because the
whole board is a fold and one that cached anything could be wrong about what happened.
