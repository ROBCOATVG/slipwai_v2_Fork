"""What a project maker is told where no loaded language can write a browser app, from one helper.

A browser app is written in a family that answers `npm_workspace` (`npm_workspace.py`), and the keel cannot name one
. The language index can: a family release's entry records the optional members it answers (`answers`, D122,
ADR 0010). So the refusal of `generate --frontend react-vite` and of `add-frontend`, `slipwai list`'s Frontends rows
and the interview's unavailable reason all ask it the same question and say the same thing: the install line of the
language that answers, or — installed and refused — the loader's line for it, or why none can be named (FR-015,
SC-004).
