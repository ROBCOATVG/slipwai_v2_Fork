"""`slipwai bridge`: the board as a page you can answer from, served by the standard library.

The point of the page is not that it is prettier than the terminal. It is that a person answers from one
seat: a question from a stream is a line in that stream's deck log, and finding the right terminal to type
into is the friction that has questions go unanswered for an hour. Typing the answer here writes the `told`
line into the right log, and the stream's next boundary reads it.

**`http.server` and nothing else.** A dashboard that needed a web framework would be a dashboard most people
never ran. The whole server is three routes and a render.

**Local by default, and it says so.** It binds the loopback address: the page has controls that change what
a run does, and a default that put those on a network somebody shares is a default that would be wrong once
and then permanently. `--host` is there for somebody who means it.

**Writes go through the same code the verbs do.** Ringing the telegraph calls `cli_telegraph.ring`, and the
fine-tune panel calls `set_one`. A second path that wrote `harbour.json` its own way would be a second thing
to keep in step, and the first one to drift.
