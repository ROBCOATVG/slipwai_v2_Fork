"""`slipwai list` and `slipwai language list|install|upgrade|remove`: what this copy can do, and its languages.

`list` is every section a project maker chooses from — languages, frontends, targets, axes, extensions, and what
adoption does with no language at all — and takes no argument. `language list` is its first section.
Each row that is not installed names the command that installs it, as this machine would run it. An index that cannot
be read is said, with the local-source form, and what is installed is still shown: never an empty list.
