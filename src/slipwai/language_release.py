"""A language release file, and a local source read before anything is written.

A release is one gzip tar holding one top-level directory, `<name>/`: the package directory as
`contracts/language-package.md` lays it out. Its members are regular files and directories only, and it is made the
same way every time (`contracts/language-index.md`, *A release file*), so a digest published for it holds. A local
source is a release file or an unpacked package directory, a checkout of a language's own repository included: what
it installs as is the `name` its `language.json` gives, whatever the directory is called.

Unpacking never asks `tarfile` to extract: every member is held to the format first, and only then is any byte
written, so an archive with one bad member writes nothing.
