"""The entry for the release in flight, held as one file per change under `changelog.d/`.

A released entry is finished prose in `CHANGELOG.md`. The entry being written is not: every branch in flight
adds its own paragraph to it, and while that entry was a block of lines at the top of one file, every pair of
branches that overlapped in time was two branches inserting at the same spot. `union` in `.gitattributes`
made the merge itself clean, and was still not enough — a forge decides whether to *offer* the merge with
`git merge-file` in a bare repository, which knows nothing of merge drivers, so the pull request read as
conflicted for a merge that would have succeeded. One file per change has no shared line to conflict on, in
any tool, and `make release` assembles them into the entry in the commit it tags.

Three readers, one shape. `scripts/tag-release.py` assembles and deletes them; `tests/test_changelog.py`
holds each one to the shape and the set of them to the number `VERSION` carries; and `catch_up.py` reads
them as the entry for a snapshot, because a project migrating onto `1.15.0.dev7` is owed what the release it
is a snapshot of asks of it, and that is not written anywhere else yet.
