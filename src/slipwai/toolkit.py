    Two questions, and they are different ones. The **profile** decides the event-modelling documents and
    the model gate, which are a workflow rather than a capability. What the project **can do** decides the
    skills: a skill declares the capabilities it serves in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter (`capabilities.py`),
    and one that declares none serves every project, which is most of the catalogue. `secure-oauth-oidc` is
    eleven thousand words about a login; in a project with no identity provider it is eleven thousand words
    about nothing, and it is also a wrong turn `find-skills` can take.

    This is deliberately not the same rule as the one about a skill's *examples*. A language-shaped skill
    still ships wherever its language is not the project's, with a pseudocode disclaimer (see
    `stamp_pseudocode_notes`), because a skill nobody can read is worse guidance than one whose examples
    are in the wrong language. That reading only exists where the skill is about something the project has;
    `typescript-strict` in a Go project is not guidance in the wrong language, it is guidance about a
    language this project does not use, and it declares `typescript` for exactly that reason.

    A toolkit file the generator also writes — `docs/first-slice.md`, say — needs no entry here: `scaffold`
    writes the generated files over the copied ones, so the generated text wins by construction and there is
    no second list of "which docs are generated" to keep in step with `project/docs.py`.
