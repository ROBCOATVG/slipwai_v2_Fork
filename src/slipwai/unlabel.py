"""The adoption label's respell: what `slipwai migrate` takes off the files no merge reaches.

slipwai 1.3.x wrote "experimental" into four places a merge never carries (the `AGENTS.md` block, two survey
pages, the installed constitution copy). This release spells none of it, so a migration takes the old label off
exactly where 1.3.x put it and nowhere else, leaving every other byte of each file, line endings included, as
it is. `migrate.refresh` calls `unlabel` before it re-derives the projections, and `Refresh` is the record of
both: what was respelled, what was projected, what was left alone.
