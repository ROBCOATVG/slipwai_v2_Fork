"""What makes a catalogue valid, and the one boundary where a fault in it becomes a refusal.

`catalog.py` is what the catalogue *is* and how to read it. This is what it has to be true of, which is a
different job with a different reader: nothing here is called while a project is being written, and
everything here is called before one starts.

Three things are checked at once, because a catalogue is wrong in three ways. Against its own schema —
every axis carries its question, every option its label. Against `assets/backing-services/prune.py`, the
file a generated project prunes itself with, because two implementations of one prune would be two sets
of bugs. And against the registry, because a backend listed here with no object behind it is a menu entry
that generates nothing.

The split from `catalog.py` was forced by the structure gate: that module was at its 350-line budget
exactly, and the refusal boundary did not fit. The budget was right — the two halves have no reader in
common.
