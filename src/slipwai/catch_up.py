"""The catch-up notes a migration leaves behind: what the versions it crossed ask of a project already built.

Every version's entry carries a **Catch-up** paragraph where there is anything to say — in `CHANGELOG.md`
once the version is out, in `changelog.d/` while it is being written — put there by the person who made the
change in the commit that made it, because that is the only moment anybody knows what it will cost somebody
else's repository. `AGENTS.md` has required it for a long time. Nothing read it.

Nothing could: the changelog is the keel's file and a generated project has no copy of it. Both supported
installs put a `slipwai` on the `PATH` with no factory checkout behind it (`docs/executable.md`), and the
frozen executable unpacks its data to a temporary directory that exists only while the process runs — so an
agent working in a project cannot open the notes for the versions that project just took, however plainly
they are written.

So `migrate` writes them into the project before it returns — whether the merge committed or stopped at
conflicts — and `/catch-up` reads them there. That is the whole of this module: select the entries between
two versions, take each one's claim and its catch-up paragraph verbatim, and render them as a page. Nothing
here summarises, and nothing infers — an entry whose author wrote no catch-up paragraph is reported as
having written none, because printing it as "asked nothing" would be a promise this cannot make.

And the page is always written once the merge changed anything. When the versions crossed cannot be told —
a project made before 1.6.0 recorded no version, both sides are snapshots of one release, the changelog has
no entry between them — the file says which of those it is and lists what it can, because an absent file
reads as "nothing owed" and a project that crossed twenty versions with no record of it is owed the most.

The range needs no searching. `migrate` reads `updatedWith` from `project.json` before it merges and knows
the version it is merging, so the two bounds are already in its hands — where the manifest has them. One
written by a factory before 1.6.0 has no `generator` at all, and nothing in the project says which of the
versions before it did the scaffolding; every entry above the first is listed then, with that said first.
