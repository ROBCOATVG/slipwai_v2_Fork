"""What an axis is, and what the catalog has to say about one before anything reads it.

An **axis** is one role asked as one question — how a service decides and records a write, how it keeps its
data, what accepts inbound HTTP, who authenticates the people who run the product, who authenticates the
people it is for. `validate_axes`
is the whole of what
`catalog.json` promises about them: the set is fixed, every option says which backends and targets it is
implemented for and which feature owns its files, and a default never resolves to nothing for a backend that
could have been given something. It lives beside `catalog.py` rather than inside it because the axis rules
are most of that module's length and none of its lookups.

    never a protocol: every
    `auth` answer is an OIDC issuer, which is exactly why that axis is not called `oidc`. Naming the role is
    what lets `postgres` and `keycloak` stop being alternatives on one menu: they answer unrelated questions,
    so they are asked separately and answered independently. It is also why Keycloak answers two axes: who
    authenticates internally and who authenticates externally are different questions with the same kind of answer.

    Every option declares which backends it is implemented for, which targets it is offered under (see
    `targets.py`), which containers it needs, which marker
    feature owns its files, and — see `features.TRAITS` — whether that feature has migrations to apply and
    a suite the Docker-free gate cannot run. Those declarations are what the generator reads instead of
    naming a product, so a second container-backed store needs no new conditional. Nothing half-ported is
