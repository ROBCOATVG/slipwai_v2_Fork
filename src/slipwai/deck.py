"""One stream's log, as a person reads it: a line each, in the words of what happened.

`fleet.py` folds every log into a board — eight columns and a count. That answers *is anything stuck*, and
the moment the answer is yes the next question is always the same one: **what has this stream actually been
doing?** The board cannot answer it, because the answer is forty lines of one file and the board is one row.

So this is the other half: the stream's own log, newest last, each line said rather than printed. A
`mark-set` is not `{"kind": "mark-set", "mark": "OrderPlaced"}`; it is *set OrderPlaced*, and the
difference between those two is whether somebody who is not holding the format in their head can read it.

**It says the kind it does not know.** A line of a kind this has no sentence for is shown as its kind and
its fields rather than skipped — the log grows, and a reader meeting an unfamiliar line should see that
there was one.
