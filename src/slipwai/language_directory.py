"""Where languages live on disk, and how a package in that directory is read and imported.

A language is a directory: `language.json`, the fragment of the catalog it adds, and `slipwai_language_<name>/`,
the Python that answers the backend protocol. `SLIPWAI_LANGUAGES` names the one directory the keel looks in and
replaces the default, `~/.slipwai/languages`, whole; the same code runs in a checkout, the wheel and the
executable, and only what is in the directory differs.

Two phases, because a package's Python imports the keel modules that import the catalog, and the catalog is built
from the fragments: `read` takes the fragments alone and refuses what they get wrong, and `import_package`
imports one package's Python later, when the registry is first asked for. Neither installs anything, touches
`sys.path` or reads an entry point. Every fault in either phase is one line, `language <name> (<directory>):
<fault>`, and a refused package is dropped while the others load.
