"""Language markers in the canonical toolkit, and the disclaimer on what is still TypeScript.

A skill in `assets/toolkit/` is written once and carries `{{example: <skill>/<id>}}` where a code sample
belongs; the snippet comes from `assets/languages/<language>/examples/`. A project whose services are written
in more than one language gets every one of them at each marker, each block labelled with its language and
the services it is for, so the agent working in a Go service beside a TypeScript one finds the Go version
where it is looking. A skill whose examples have not been translated yet ships with a note saying so rather
than being withheld, because a skill nobody can read is worse guidance than one whose examples are in the
wrong language.
