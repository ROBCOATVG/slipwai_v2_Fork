"""`slipwai upgrade`: making this copy the newest one, whichever way it was installed.

There are four ways to have a `slipwai` and no two of them are made newer by the same command — a tool
environment `uv` owns, a package inside somebody's virtual environment, a single-file executable that cannot
overwrite itself while it is running, and a checkout whose newest version arrives as a merge. Whoever
installed it six months ago does not remember which of the four they chose, and the command that would tell
them is the one they are looking for. So this verb works it out and does the right thing: it runs the
upgrade where running it is safe, and where it is not — a binary replacing itself, a working tree that may
have local commits in it — it prints exactly what to do instead and touches nothing.

It asks the registry what the newest version is before it does any of that,
rather than handing the whole question to the installer. Public installs ask
PyPI; an install whose uv receipt names an internal mirror keeps asking that
mirror, and `SLIPWAI_INDEX` remains the explicit override.
