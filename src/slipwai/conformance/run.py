"""Run the suite over one package: start a fresh interpreter whose package directory is the one named, read its report.

The merged catalog is read at the first `import slipwai.catalog`, from `SLIPWAI_LANGUAGES`, so a package directory
is only a process's own if it is set before that import. `check` therefore never reads the catalog in the caller's
process: it starts `python -m slipwai.conformance.probe` with the directory set and this `slipwai` first on the path,
and reads the report the probe writes to a file. The command line and `ConformanceCase` both come through here, so they
cannot disagree, and a test process that has already merged another directory is left as it was.
