"""The six obligations, run rather than described.

A language's conformance suite asks the package questions and checks the answers. An extension answers
nothing — it is a script that runs in a project and changes it — so its suite is the other shape: build a
scratch project, run the entry point in it, and look at what happened to the project.

**What it is run against is a scratch project, not a generated one.** Generating one needs a language
installed, which an extension's publisher has no reason to have, and the obligations are all about files an
extension touches rather than about any language's skeleton. So the scratch project is `project.json`, an
`AGENTS.md` with a person's paragraph in it, and the package's own files where `./init` would put them.

**Four of the six are run; two are read.** `idempotent`, `non-fatal`, `projects` and `merges` are facts
about what the entry point did, and they are checked by doing it twice. `gated` is a fact about what the
package ships. `recovers` is checked against what the entry point actually printed: a line reporting a
problem that carries no command is the failure that obligation exists to stop, and a line nobody printed is
not something this can check — so the suite says which lines it read rather than claiming more.
