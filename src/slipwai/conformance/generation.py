"""The `profiles` and `targets` checks: generate each backend the way a project maker would, and read what it needs.

A profile is answered when `slipwai generate --profile <p> --skip-checks` succeeds for the backend; where the profile
asks where events live, the backend must also offer an event store and answer its files, because generation skips a
feature the layout lacks and would pass with no store at all. Every profile is generated under the
backend's first target, and the richest profile once under every target it declares, with the event store that
target provisions where it offers one, so a backend with four targets costs five generations. `--frontend none`:
the suite checks a language, not a browser app.
