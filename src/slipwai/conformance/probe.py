"""The checks themselves, run in the interpreter `run.check` starts with the package directory already set.

`python -m slipwai.conformance.probe <language-dir> <package> <report>` writes `{"findings": {check: [line, …]},
"not_run": {check: reason}}` to the file `<report>` and exits 0 whatever it found: a finding is the package's, and
only a crash of the suite itself exits otherwise. Nothing it prints is the report, so nothing a package prints is.
Imported only here, with `SLIPWAI_LANGUAGES` naming the directory, because the merged catalog is read at import
and the directory is the one the author named. A SIGTERM ends it as `SystemExit`, which removes its temporary
directory.
