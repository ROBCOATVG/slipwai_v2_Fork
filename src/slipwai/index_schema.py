"""What a chandlery index document says, in both the formats a published one may be written in.

Version 1 listed languages: a `languages` object, a list of releases under each name, each release carrying
its file, the file's digest and its `language.json`. Nothing else was publishable, so nothing else was
described.

**Version 2 lists packages.** An extension is a package the way a language is, and an index that could only
list one of them would make the other a thing people pass paths around for. So the block is `packages`, each
entry declares its `kind`, and the manifest is under the key that names it — `language` or `extension` — which
is also how a reader with no `kind` field still knows what it is holding.

**Four fields arrive with it, and each answers a question a person asked of version 1.** `publisher`, because
"who published this?" had no answer. `signature`, because the digest proves the file is the file the index
lists and says nothing about who put it there (6.5 verifies it; this only carries it). `description` and
`tags`, because `slipwai search` could match a name and nothing else, and a person searching for "a code
index" does not know it is called codegraph.

**Both formats are read.** Published v1 indexes exist, and an index is a file on someone else's server: a
keel that could only read the newer one would make upgrading the keel break the index. A v1 document is read
as packages of kind `language`, which is what it was.

This module is the document's shape alone — no fetching, no network, nothing that can fail slowly — so the
shape can be tested without a server and read without one.
