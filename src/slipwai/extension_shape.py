"""What an `extension.json` declares, and the six obligations an extension's entry point has to meet.

An extension is a package like a language is, and this is its half of the loader's contract. The difference
between the two kinds is narrow and worth stating: a language is asked at `slipwai generate`, to write the
skeleton; an extension is elected at `./init`, after the skeleton exists, and never changes generated code.
Everything else — found through the chandlery, signed, installed into a directory, loaded by the same loader
— is the same, which is why the manifests differ only in what they declare.

**The six obligations are not style.** Each is a failure somebody had.

1. **Replaceably idempotent.** Running `./init --extension <key>` twice does what running it once did.
   Anything else makes "did it work?" into "how many times has it run?".
2. **Installs what it needs, and is non-fatal when it cannot.** A dev tool that is not on this machine is
   not a reason a project cannot be set up. It says what is missing and the project still works.
3. **Projects a marker-fenced block into `AGENTS.md`.** Fenced, so the next projection replaces exactly
   that block and leaves what a person wrote around it.
4. **Gates whatever state can go stale.** An extension that writes an index, a cache or a lock ships a
   `check-<key>.py`, because stale state that nothing checks is state nobody trusts and everybody rebuilds.
5. **Names a recovery command on every failure path.** The house rule for every refusal in this repository:
   a message saying what is wrong and not what to do about it costs the reader a search.
6. **Merges rather than overwrites a file a person hand-edited.** Anything else means a person's edit is
   lost by an install they ran for an unrelated reason, which is how a tool becomes something people avoid
   running.
