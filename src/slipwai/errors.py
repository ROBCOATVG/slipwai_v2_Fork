"""The one shape a refusal has: what is wrong, and the command that puts it right.

Version 1 wrote its refusals by hand, one f-string at a time, and the experiment then needed nine test
files to hold their wording — `test_refusals_verbs.py`, `test_refusals_loader.py`,
`test_refusals_name_the_fix.py` and six more — because nothing but a test could tell whether a given
refusal had remembered to name the fix. A type remembers for them.

A `Fault` is one thing that is wrong and, where a command would put it right, that command. A `Refusal`
carries every fault found rather than the first, says them in one line, and ends that line with the
command. `refuse` is how a verb reports one: `slipwai <verb>: error: <line>` on stderr and exit status 2,
with no `usage:` block — a refusal about the machine or the project is not about the command line, and a
usage block under it says it was. argparse's own errors keep theirs.

One line, always. A package's name, a path, or a backend key may hold a newline; `one_line` writes it out
as its escape rather than letting it break the shape a reader and a log parser both depend on.
