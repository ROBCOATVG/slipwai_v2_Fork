"""The moments an extension may attach to: a closed set the keel owns, declared once.

Version 1's extension did three things at three moments — it installed at `./init`, it re-projected its
`AGENTS.md` block on `make agents`, and it contributed a gate to `make verify` — and each was a convention
rather than a declaration. The cost showed in `codegraph`, which wanted to sync after every delegate and
could only get there through Claude Code's own hooks, so it worked on one harness and silently did nothing
on the others. A convention is a thing each extension rediscovers and each harness breaks differently.

**The set is closed, like the axes.** An extension attaches to a point; it does not invent one. A point is
a promise the keel keeps about when something runs and what it is given, and a point an extension could add
would be a promise nobody made.

Three rules make this safe to have, and they are what keep a hook from becoming a second control plane.

**The captain depends on no hook.** Its controls — the last line, the controlled-files diff, the bounded
waits, the inbox receipt — all work with every hook removed. A hook is a second belt. That is already the
rule for the harnesses' own hooks and it holds for these.

**A hook is never fatal to the rung.** It is reported, as a `hook` line naming the extension, the point and
the last thing it printed, and the rung completes. An extension that could fail a stage is an extension
that can stop a delivery loop it was added to help.

**The resolved registry is a controlled file.** `.slipwai/hooks.json` is written from the elected
extensions' manifests, and an iteration that edits it is refused like one that edits a gate — so a run
cannot register a hook on itself.

#: These were run by *convention* until slice 6.1e: `./init --extension` executed a file called `init.py`
#: and `make agents` imported it and called a function called `project_guidance()`, so an extension that
#: declared a different script at either point was ignored — the convention-not-declaration failure this
#: module opens by describing, with the keel's own name on it. A default declaration closes it without
#: making every manifest repeat what every extension already does: the point is fired through the registry
#: like the other eight, and an extension that wants another script says so and is obeyed.
#:
#: Both default to the entry point because that is the one file an extension is guaranteed to have. What
#: tells the two apart is `SLIPWAI_POINT`, which the firing script sets: at `init` an entry point installs
#: whatever it installs and projects its block; at `project` it projects and installs nothing, because a
#: re-projection happens on every `make agents` and is not an election.
