"""The backend protocol and the registry that holds every backend's answers to it.

`PROTOCOL` declares every per-backend answer a language gives, and which are required. A `Backend` or a
`Family` carries its `answers`, keyed by the `Member` constant; `Registry.answer` reads a backend's own
answer and otherwise its family's. Presence is the test, so `None` is an answer rather than a gap. `load`
refuses a registry the protocol cannot hold, in one line naming every fault at once rather than the first.

This module imports nothing from the answers or parts tiers, so a callable's signature stays loose here,
and it never imports a language: a package is found through the loader, by name, at call time. The shapes
are fixed in `docs/backend-protocol.md`, and `tests/test_registry.py` holds that page's member table to
`PROTOCOL` — the page and the code cannot drift.

`registry()` is the built-once-per-process entry point. Its body reaches for `slipwai.loaded` by name at
call time, not at import, which is what lets the catalogue import this module while the loader imports the
catalogue. The conformance suite builds its own with `load` instead, from one package and nothing else.
