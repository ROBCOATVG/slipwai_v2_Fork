"""Building a release of either kind of package, and putting it in a channel.

A release is three things: a file, a digest of that file, and an entry in a channel's index saying where the
file is and what is in it. Version 1 had the first two and a person wrote the third by hand, into one
`index.json` that every publisher edited — which is the shared line every other part of this method has
already removed once, and it goes the same way here.

**One file per entry.** A channel repository holds `entries/<name>-<version>.json`, and its index is built
from them. Two publishers releasing on one afternoon touch two files and never meet; the index is a
regeneration rather than a resolution, which is `changelog.d/`'s shape and `render-fairways`' and the
events index's.

**The entry is written from the package, never typed.** Its manifest, its version, its digest: all of it is
read off the thing being released. What a publisher writes is the description and the tags, in the manifest,
where they are also what the keel reads — so there is one place to get them wrong rather than two places to
get them out of step.

**Registering is a file operation, and that is deliberate.** A channel is a directory of JSON, served as a
static site. `register` writes into a checkout of one; whether that checkout is pushed, reviewed or merged
is the channel's own business, which is what makes a private channel and the public one the same shape.

**The release file does not have to live in the channel, and should not.** An entry's `file` may be an
absolute URL, which the client joins against nothing and fetches anonymously — the channel's credentials
go only to the channel's own origin, and the digest proves the bytes either way. So the ordinary
arrangement is the tarball on the tag that built it and the channel holding JSON alone: git keeps every
version of every file for ever, and a channel that stored its own tarballs would grow without bound while
GitHub already hosts the same bytes for nothing.
