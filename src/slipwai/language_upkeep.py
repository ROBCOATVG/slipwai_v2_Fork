"""`language upgrade` and `language remove`: moving an installed language, or taking one out.

An upgrade is the newest counted release above the installed version that this keel can load and that keeps every
framework's `requires` true — the framework's own, against its family as it will be, and each installed framework's,
against a family that moves — or the local source given. It is carried out as an install is: staged, admitted beside
what stays, renamed into place. A removal is refused while a framework of the family stays installed. A language
built into the keel moves with slipwai itself, so neither verb touches one.
