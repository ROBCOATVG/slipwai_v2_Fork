"""The plan, read in the interpreter `run.plan` starts with the package directory already set.

`python -m slipwai.matrix.plan <language-dir> <package> <report>` writes the backends the package owns, each one's
native-gate rows and its image row to the file `<report>`, as JSON, and exits 0; where the package does not load, or
the catalog has outgrown the rows, it writes `{"refused": [line, …]}` instead. Nothing it prints is the report, so
nothing a package prints at import is. Imported only here, because the merged catalog is read at import and the
package directory is the one the maintainer named.

The backends are the package's own (`conformance.probe.owned`): a framework is planned with its family beside it and
owns its own backends, and a family with no backend of its own owns none, its frameworks' matrices generating it
.
