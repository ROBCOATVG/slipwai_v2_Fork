"""The native-gate rows of one backend: what `slipwai generate` is asked for, before each project's own gate runs.

Moved from the root suite's `tests/test_matrix.py` and `tests/test_images.py`, not rewritten. Both profiles and
both frontend answers, without multiplying them: adding a frontend does not change a service's native tree, so the
other diagonal would run the same backend gate twice. `standard` proves the deliberately smaller service;
`event-modelling` proves the larger one and carries the browser gate. Then the maximal selection on each store — the
SQLite one runs its whole contract inside the Docker-free gate — with the backend's own transport, read from the
catalog rather than listed, so a backend added last is never silently skipped. Then the production row: every row
before it leaves `--target` at `none`, and a production target is what wires the flags route into a project, so this
is where a linter first reads it. The image row is the backend on `aws` with the memory store, the project `make
build smoke-image` builds and starts.

Pure over the catalog it is given: the plan probe passes the merged catalog of the package directory it was started
for, and a test can pass a copy.
