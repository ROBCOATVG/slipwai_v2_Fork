"""What building and starting a production image on this machine's daemon needs: the platform, and a registry for
`pack`. Moved from the root suite's `tests/test_images.py`, so a package's matrix carries its image probe.

A backend whose builder is `pack` publishes to a registry: Docker Desktop's containerd image store cannot take a
`pack` export directly (buildpacks/pack#2272), so a throwaway `registry:2` is started on the daemon's own loopback — on
the host network, listening on 127.0.0.1 itself rather than behind a published port, the proxy of which
intermittently refused the connection (run 216) — and `pack`'s containers share that network to reach it. Those
backends are built for Fargate's platform, `linux/amd64`, wherever this machine can run such a container, and for its
own otherwise: one platform for every `pack` build on a daemon, because `--pull-policy if-not-present` hands pack
whichever variant of the builder the daemon already holds (run 228). `IMAGE_REGISTRY` in the environment names a
registry to use instead; `PACK_FLAGS` is passed on, for a machine that needs more.

Every `pack` build names its build cache (`pack_cache`), per backend and per ref: left to pack, the volume is named
after an image on a random port, so no build ever found the cache the one before it left (run 140). Every build runs
with `--timestamps`, its phase lines printed on success too, so the log says where a slow one spent its time.
