"""`MatrixCase`: a package's generated-variant matrix as a `unittest` case, for its own `tests/test_matrix.py`.

A package subclasses it and names where it is, as it does `ConformanceCase`::

    from pathlib import Path
    from slipwai import matrix

    class Matrix(matrix.MatrixCase):
        language_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]
        package = "go"

The plan is read once for the class, in a fresh interpreter (`run.plan`). `test_every_native_gate_variant_passes_its_
own_gate` generates each row and runs the project's own `make verify` in it, one subtest per row; `test_every_backends
_image_starts_and_answers_its_probe` builds each backend's production image and starts it, where Docker is here. A row
only one package has is a test of that package's subclass, built on `generate`, `verify` and `require`.

The case **skips unless `SLIPWAI_MATRIX=1`**, saying why: it takes minutes and every toolchain, and a package's tests
are collected wherever they are discovered — the root suite's run of every package's tests among them. The command
line and the root shims set `opted_in` instead. `only` restricts a run to some backends; `gate`, `image_gate` and
`image_tools` are the commands it runs and the tool each image builder needs, which a test of the case replaces.
