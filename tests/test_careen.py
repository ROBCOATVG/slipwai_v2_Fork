"""The careen: where work goes when a slice may not carry it and may not drop it.

The first attempt had no such place, so work went two ways and both were wrong. Gaps were carried — 18 from
S08 to S09, 31 from S09 to S13, 46 from S12 to S13, until two whole slices existed only to collect the debt
— and a slice that inherits a gap pays for it without having chosen to. Or findings were argued: 129
adversary findings over 21 rounds, 64 of them LOW and most about wording, with S20 still ending on five
open. Neither is a decision about whether the work matters.

So there is a named destination and a bar. Below the bar a finding is stowed with the slice that found it,
and the slice merges. At or above it, it closes first. A CRITICAL is never stowed at all.
