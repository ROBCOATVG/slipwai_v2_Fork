"""`harbour.json`: the numbers a run is held to, and what a stage does when it reaches one.

The experiment spent 104 hours and, at its worst, hundreds of millions of input tokens on a single slice,
with nothing anywhere saying what too much was. A stage that has no budget cannot be over one, so the only
signals were a person noticing and the bill arriving. Both are late.

What is held here is that the numbers exist, that they are in the project rather than in a prompt, and that
reaching one means stowing rather than stopping — with the two exceptions where stowing would be dishonest.
