"""The parts that write `/cruise` into a generated project, and the ones `./init` writes.

`/cruise` is the same fleet as `/sail` with nobody at the keyboard: the skipper answers the product
questions a person would have been asked, and the hand runs the demos. These modules write the commands
and the stop table that make that safe — what the skipper may decide, what it must stop for, and what it
must repeat verbatim rather than summarise.

As with the rest of the parts, the experiment's suites generate a project to read the pages back, so
they return in 3.3z. Held here is what the prose must say wherever it lands, and in particular the
places where paraphrase would be a bug.
