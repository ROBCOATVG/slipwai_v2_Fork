"""The two identity axes are internal and external, and the stacks moved their state rather than losing it.

`Staff` and `Customer` were a guess about who uses the product. Internal and external say the thing that
actually differs — which side of the organisation an account is on.

The half of this that matters is the terraform. **A resource address is state, not a name.** Renaming
`aws_cognito_user_pool.staff` to `.internal` is, to terraform, one resource destroyed and another created,
which for a user pool is every account in it gone on the next apply. Every renamed address carries a `moved`
block, and this is the suite that says so — because the failure it prevents is silent until somebody runs
`tofu apply` against production.
