"""The skills are one catalogue, in version 2's words, and the rename table says only what is true.

Three things are held here, and each cost the first attempt something.

**One catalogue.** Phase 0 copied all 53 skills into `.claude/skills/` so that every session in this fork
had `tdd`, `testing` and the rest from its first commit, and slice 3.2 brought the same files back under
`assets/toolkit/skills/`, which is what a generated project receives. Two tracked copies of one catalogue
drift: a rename lands in whichever one the session had open, and nothing afterwards says which is right.
From slice 5.1 the toolkit is the only tracked copy; `make skills` materialises the other locally, and
`.gitignore` keeps it out of the history.

**Version 2's words.** The plan's rule is that nothing in version 2 is called a workstation, a workstream,
a lane or a runner. Those words also mean other things in English, and the skills use them in those other
senses — a test runner, an event model's lanes — so `ANOTHER_SENSE` allows a word to one named skill at a
time, with the sense it means there. A skill not named may not use the word at all, which is what holds
the next skill, and the next edit to an existing one, to the vocabulary.

**A rename table that cannot lie.** `docs/rename.json` is what `migrate` applies to a version 1 project
(slice 8.3). A row claiming a rename nobody made would move a person's file to a name version 2 has not
got, so every row is checked here in both directions: the old name is gone, and the new one is there.
