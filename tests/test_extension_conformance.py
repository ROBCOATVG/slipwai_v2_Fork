    `recovers` asks that every failure path names the command that fixes it. It read line by line, and
    every real message is written the other way — the trouble, then `Install it:`, then the command,
    indented — so the first line of every one of them failed and the command two lines below was never
    seen. All three published extensions were written that way.

    `projects` asks that the AGENTS.md block is marker-fenced. It excused an entry point that stopped
    because its own tool was missing, recognised by words like `not found`; but the scratch project is
    deliberately bare, so an extension that acts on a browser app correctly does nothing there and says
    `this project has no browser app for it to design` — no such words, and it was failed for doing the
