"""The four validators the catalogue is held to, each against a catalogue built here rather than the real one.

`features`, `extensions`, `targets` and `axes` say what is wrong with a catalogue. In version 1 they were
tested through `slipwai.catalog.CATALOG` — the real, whole, valid one — so a red result named the
catalogue and not the rule, and a rule could only be tested by breaking the file every other suite read.
Here each refusal is provoked by the smallest catalogue that provokes it.

What these do not do is end on a command. A refusal reaches a person through `catalog.validate_catalog`,
which is where it becomes a `Refusal` of `Fault`s with the fix named; a validator deep in the schema check
does not know whether the reader should edit `catalog.json`, reinstall a package or upgrade the keel.
That wrapping is slice 2.3's, at the one boundary that knows.

Two of the eight entry points are missing here, and deliberately. `validate_axes` and `validate_targets`
hold the catalogue against `assets/backing-services/prune.py` — the same tables, kept in two places
because a generated project prunes itself with the second — and that comparison is only meaningful
against the real catalogue. A synthetic one fails on the mirror before it reaches the rule under test.
They are tested in slice 2.3, with the `catalog.json` they mirror. What is here is everything that takes
an option, an entry or a small map rather than the whole catalogue.
