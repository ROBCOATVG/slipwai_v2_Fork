"""Two gates, not one: what an increment pays for, and what runs once before the merge.

In the first attempt one `make verify` did everything, so every increment paid for lint, typecheck,
structure and the whole suite. The owner's own note in the experiment was "use full verify sparingly, it's
heavy", which is a gate nobody runs. Theme B item 9 splits it: the fast checks per increment inside a
slice, the full gate once on the rebased branch before `main`.

A generated project needs its own `unit` for that, and which of its targets are fast is the backends' to
say rather than the keel's to assume — so `fast_targets` is a protocol member with a default that answers
every backend that has nothing to add.
