"""The parts that write the model, the frontend and the ladder's own table of stages.

`stage_models` is the one worth reading twice: it declares every rung of `/drive` and, per rung, the
role whose model runs it and what a delegate at that rung may write. It is how a project puts a bigger
model on deciding than on typing, and how a read-only stage is kept read-only.

Their suites generate a project and come back in 3.3z.
