"""The one refusal shape, held as one table instead of nine files of wording.

The experiment needed `test_refusals_verbs.py`, `test_refusals_loader.py`, `test_refusals_name_the_fix.py`
and six more, because nothing but a test could tell whether a hand-written refusal had remembered to name
the fix. The type remembers now, so what is left to hold is the type: every rendering is one line, every
rendering that has a fix ends with it, and every fault found is said rather than only the first.
