"""`check-chart`, run against hand-written charts: one fixture per way a chart can be wrong.

The chart is the one file a captain and a gate both read on either profile, and every rule in the gate is
there because its absence fails quietly. A mark nobody set leaves a slice uncleared with nothing saying on
what. A mark set twice is two schemas for one name, resolved by whichever merged last. A withdrawn mark is
a contract taken from under whoever steered by it. A slice with no capability is never demoed, and a loop
that stops nobody looks exactly like a loop with nothing to show.

So each is written here as a chart that should be refused, beside one that should pass, because a gate
proven only against good input is a gate proven against nothing. The script is run the way a generated
project runs it — a subprocess, from a tree laid out like a project — rather than imported, since that is
the thing a project's `make verify` actually calls.
