"""`replay`: this keel's output for a project's recorded answers, as a commit that project can merge.

Three claims, each gated. The manifest is a complete record — a replay of a project by the keel that made
it is byte-identical to it. The commit is a merge base — it sits on the project's root, so a newer factory's
changes and the project's own changes meet in a three-way merge that keeps both, and conflict only where both
touched the same lines. And what the project took away stays away — a feature pruned with `./init` is not
offered back. The "newer factory" is this checkout copied aside with one skill changed and `VERSION` raised,
which is what a newer factory is.
