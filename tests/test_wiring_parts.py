"""The parts that wire a generated project together: its composition root, its pins, its permissions.

These write the files a project is held together by rather than the pages it is read through. The
experiment proved them by generating and reading back, so those suites return in 3.3z; what is here is
what each has to be true of before any project exists.

The pins get the most attention. A pin is the difference between a repository that builds the same way
on two machines and one that does not, and a range dressed as a pin is the shape that hides it.
