"""The catalogue the keel ships, and the one boundary where a fault in it becomes a refusal.

`catalog.json` is the questions the keel asks. It carries no backend at all: a backend is a package's to
declare, and a keel that named one would be a keel a new language has to be edited into. What it does
carry — the four axes, the targets, the profiles, the frontends, the extensions — is held here against
three things at once: its own schema, the pruner that ships into every generated project, and the
registry of whatever is loaded.

`validate_axes` and `validate_targets` are tested here rather than in `test_validators.py` because both
hold the catalogue against `assets/backing-services/prune.py`, and a catalogue built in a test fails on
that mirror before it reaches the rule under test. This is the file that has the real one.
