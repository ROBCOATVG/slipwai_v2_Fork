"""The stacks an `azure` project is given, read as HCL and held to the real providers.

The apply itself ends in somebody's subscription and is unprovable here. What is proved instead: what the
stacks say about how a release reaches production and how it is undone, the apply-time decisions
`tofu validate` cannot see, and that every variant this keel writes — maximal, minimal, and maximal
pruned to minimal — validates against the pinned azurerm, azapi and azuread providers.
