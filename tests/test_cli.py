"""What the keel answers before it can do anything: which keel this is.

The version is read from the `VERSION` file rather than repeated in code, and where that file sits depends
on how slipwai is being run — a checkout, an installed wheel, or a frozen executable. Only the checkout
case can be gated from here, so what this file holds is the part that is the same in all three: the string
the command prints is the string the file holds, and `--version` is a clean exit rather than an error.
