"""A decision is read against what the project already does, and the record says which authority answered.

`/cruise`'s skipper protocol named three things a decision could be settled by without asking a delegate:
the standing entries, the specification, the constitution. All three are documents this method owns. A
generated project ten slices in, and an adopted repository on its first day, both hold conventions that
none of them names — how this codebase already publishes, how one handler reaches the next, how a
migration is named — and a decision taken without them is how a codebase ends up with two ways of doing
one thing, each defensible on its own. That is the fourth authority, and 15.15 adds it.

Held here rather than in the gate's own tests because it lives in three places that have to agree: the
procedure that says what to read, the entry shape that reserves somewhere to say it, and
`check-decisions.py`, which is what makes it true rather than advisory. Two of the three agreeing is the
failure this file exists for — a shape with a field nobody fills, or a gate asking for a field the shape
never showed.
