"""The loop, end to end, in a project the keel generated.

Every other suite proves one link. This drives the chain: generate a project, write a model into it, render
the chart, run its gate, run a captain over it with a stand-in for `/drive`, carry the lines with the
harbourmaster, and read the board back.

It exists because three faults were found by hand in ten minutes doing exactly this, and none of them could
have been found by the other suites — each was a *disagreement between two things* that are tested apart:
the renderer against its own gate, the model schema against the gate's demands, the renderer against a
project that has a web app as well as a service.

The claim it is really here to hold is the one version 2 rests on: **a sibling is cleared by a mark being
set, not by anything merging.** If that ever stops being true the method has no parallelism in it, and
nothing else in the suite would notice.
