"""A project, generated, and read back off the disk.

This is the first test that runs the whole keel end to end: the catalogue merged with a package, the
registry built from it, the scaffold assembling a tree, and the files written. Until slice 3.8 put the
toy package in the directory there was nothing to generate with, and until 4.1 brought `generate` there
was no verb to do it.

It is slow — it writes seven hundred files — so it is in the Makefile's `SLOW` list and runs in
`make verify` rather than `make unit`. That is the two-gate split working as intended: the fast gate
stays worth running and the expensive proof still happens before anything merges.
