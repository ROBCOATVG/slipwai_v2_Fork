"""`scripts/agents/session.py`: the harness's own moments, and the two closed sets fired from one place.

The bug this file is written over is older than the script. Version 1 reached three harness moments by
having the keel write `scripts/agents/cruise.py <verb>` straight into `.claude/settings.json`, so the
control-file refusal and the compaction protocol were behaviours of *one harness*: on Claude Code they
worked, and on the other thirty-five they were absent with nothing saying so. Both closed sets exist to end
that, and `session.py` is where they are fired from.

So the tests that matter most here are the two that hold the wiring rather than the behaviour: every verb
the script answers is a point of one of the two sets, and every verb the keel writes into a harness's
settings is a verb the script answers. A row naming a verb that is not there fails exactly the way the old
shape failed — silently, for ever.
