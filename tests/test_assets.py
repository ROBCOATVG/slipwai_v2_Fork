"""The asset trees, and the modules that read them.

Four trees arrived together — the toolkit, the profiles, the frontends and the adoption ratchet — because
`toolkit.py`, `examples.py` and `harness.py` cannot be asked anything without them. Their own suites in
the experiment generate a project to check the answer, which needs the scaffold and comes back in slice
3.3b. What is here is what can be asked of a tree directly: that it is there, that reading it is faithful
to the bytes, and that a path leaving it is refused.

The last of those is the one that matters. A package supplies code the keel runs and files the keel
copies, and `inside` is the whole of what stops one reading somebody else's.
