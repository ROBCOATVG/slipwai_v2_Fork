"""Which harness a headless session runs through, and what it is asked.

This is the module `captain.py` fell back from. Its fallback was `scripts/agents/drive.py`, the *settings
reader* for `/drive`, which handed a slice and a fairway prints its table and exits 0 — and a whole real
run was reported through on the strength of it. The refusals matter as much as the choice: "no harness" has
three causes and three different things a person does about them.

Run as a module here rather than as a script: it is a library in the toolkit, and the keel's suite is where
its arithmetic is held.
