"""The parts that write the ladder into a generated project: its settings, its stages, its boards.

Every one of these returns prose that ends up in a page an agent reads, and in the experiment each was
tested by generating a project and reading the page back — which needs the scaffold, so those suites
return in slice 3.3z. What is held here is what the prose has to say whatever project it lands in.

`drive_settings` gets the most attention, because it carries the two widths the delivery loop is
actually driven by: how much one implementation delegate is handed, and how many failing tests a
red-green-refactor cycle opens with. Section 5 of the plan calls example mapping and that cycle the two
things both profiles share and neither optional; this is the file that writes them down.
