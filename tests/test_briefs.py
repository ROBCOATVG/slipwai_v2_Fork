"""The standing briefs as assets: that the substitution is closed, and that moving them changed no byte.

Two things are held here and they answer different fears.

**The substitution is closed, both ways.** Nothing under `assets/` was templated before the briefs moved
there, so `{{make}}` is a new kind of mistake this repository has no habit of catching: a file that is valid
markdown whether or not its placeholders resolved, copied into somebody's repository, where the literal
`{{make}}` reads as a typo in the method rather than as a bug in the keel. So every token an asset names must
be one `briefs.values` provides — otherwise generation refuses, and this says so before a person finds out —
and every value `briefs.values` provides must be named by some asset, because a token nothing uses is a value
somebody will keep in step with a path that moved for no reader at all.

**The move changed nothing a project receives.** `tests/fixtures/agent-briefs.sha256` is what the generator
rendered at 9679053, the commit before the briefs left `agents.py`, and the test below is the only reason
that file exists: the eleven types, under two layouts, have to come back byte for byte. Two layouts because
`{{make}}` is the one value most briefs interpolate, and a record taken at the default layout alone would
pass with the substitution stubbed out to the empty string.
