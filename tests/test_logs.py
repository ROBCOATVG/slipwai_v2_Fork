"""The log line: the only thing that says what happened, and the rules that keep it trustworthy.

The first attempt's runner was the single source of status and died at iteration two; seventeen of nineteen
iterations afterwards wrote nothing at all, so the checkpoint said "iteration 2" while twenty slices merged.
In MANDA the same shape failed the other way round: `model.yaml` said `planned` for eight slices that were
built and merged, because the field was written at plan time and never reconciled.

Both are state kept somewhere other than where the work happened. A line is written by the thing that did
the work, at the moment it did it, which is what makes the rule the rest of version 2 rests on true: a slice
that wrote no line made no progress.
