"""The conformance suite and the matrix, run against the package this keel holds.

A package proves itself against the keel it is built for, and the keel proves that the suite doing the
proving works. Those are different jobs and this is the second: `python -m slipwai.conformance` is run
against `packages/toy` here, on every commit, so that a package's own CI is running something known to
work rather than something nobody has tried.

The toy is inert by design — one backend, no transport, nothing to serve — which is what makes it a
fixture rather than a language. So conformance runs against it and the matrix cannot: the matrix
generates variants and runs each one's native gate, and there is nothing to run. That refusal is held
here too, because "the matrix declined to plan anything" and "the matrix planned nothing" look the same
from outside and only one of them is correct.
