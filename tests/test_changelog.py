"""The changelog: that it says what this version is, and that nothing has been shipped unrecorded.

Two files hold one record. `CHANGELOG.md` is released prose, appended to by `make release` alone; the entry
being written is `changelog.d/`, a file per change, so no two branches in flight ever touch the same line —
`changelog.d/README.md` says why that matters more than a merge driver could. What can be checked
mechanically is: `main` carries a snapshot, the released entries descend without repeating and each names
its level, every release this repository ever tagged has one, and — the one that catches the real mistake —
the fragments and `VERSION` agree about which release is being written. The level is no longer only a claim
in a heading: the highest one the fragments make is arithmetic on the last release, and that is the number
`main` has to carry.

`scripts/changelog-draft.py` is proved here too, because a tool that exists to stop an omission is only
worth having if it is right about what has landed.
