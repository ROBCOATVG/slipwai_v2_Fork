"""The captain: what it claims, what it watches, and what parks it.

The one thing proved here over and over is the inversion the first attempt lacked: the captain believes the
deck log and nothing else. A fake `/drive` that writes the expected lines gets a slice through; a fake that
writes nothing is ended and parked, however alive its process is.

It runs inside a generated project, so it is run here as a script against a directory laid out like one.
`captain_fixture.py` beside this holds the project and the fake; `test_captain_gate.py` holds what closes a
slice and what merges it.
