"""The plan's ticks are the history's, not a person's.

A plan that records its own progress by hand is wrong by Friday, and a plan that overstates it is worse
than one that says nothing. `scripts/progress.py` writes the Status column from `git log`; this holds the
committed plan to what the script would write, and holds the script to the one rule that matters — a
slice is ticked when a commit says it landed, and not when a commit merely mentions it.
