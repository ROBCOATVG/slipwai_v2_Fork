"""Fairways: one bounded context's slices, held by one at a time, and read off the chart.

Issue #30's work, renamed as it lands. Version 1 called this a workstream and read it from a column
somebody typed into the split, which is a second place for a fact the chart already holds — and the one
that is wrong is always the one somebody typed. So the split's table is read from `chart.yaml`, and what is
held here is that the prose says so, that a session can take one fairway or every free one, and that merge
order is within a fairway rather than across.
