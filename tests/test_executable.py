"""The standalone executable's recipe, checked without building one.

Building it takes PyInstaller and several minutes, which is `make test-executable` and a release job's
work rather than the gate's. What the gate can hold is the recipe: that it bundles the keel and no
package, that every file it claims to carry exists, and that the hidden-imports line is still there —
a package is imported by name at run time, so a static analysis of `__main__` reaches none of the keel
and the executable would ship with most of itself missing.
