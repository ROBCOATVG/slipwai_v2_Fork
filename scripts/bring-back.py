"""What can be brought back next, and what each remaining module is still waiting on.

Version 2 is version 1 taken apart and reassembled, one module at a time, and the plan was written
forwards from the design while the dependencies run backwards from the code. Six slices in phase 2 turned
out to be unbuildable where they were written — `catalog.py` sits near the top of the import graph, not
the bottom; `loaded.py` reads the catalogue it was slated to arrive with; the conformance suite generates
a project and so needs the whole scaffold. Each was found by attempting it.

This finds them on paper instead. `docs/bring-back.tsv` records every module the experiment has, what it
imports, and which asset trees it reads; this reads that against what the keel has now and says which
modules are ready, which are blocked and by what.

    python3 scripts/bring-back.py              what is ready now, and the waves after it
    python3 scripts/bring-back.py --waiting     every module not back yet, and what each waits on
    python3 scripts/bring-back.py --check       fail when the keel holds a module the ledger does not

`--check` runs in the gate. It does not check the order — a person may bring a module back early and
teach the ledger why — only that nothing in `src/slipwai/` is missing from the ledger, so the next
reading of it is complete.
