"""Tick off the slices the history says are done, in the plan's own tables.

A plan that records its own progress by hand is a plan that is wrong by Friday. This reads `git log` and
writes a Status column in each phase's table of `docs/slipwai-2-plan.md`. Nothing claims to be done that
is not in the history, and nothing in the history goes unticked.

What counts as landed is the trailer `Slice-done: <n>.<m>`, not the subject line. The subject was the
first thing tried and it was wrong within an hour: the commit that *added* slice 9.5 to the plan was
written `Slice 9.5: the three contributor skills…`, and the ticker marked a slice done whose work had not
started. A trailer is deliberate. A subject is a sentence, and a sentence can be about a slice without
being the slice.

`--check` compares the committed plan against what this would write and fails if they differ, which is
what `tests/test_progress.py` runs. Finish a slice, run `make progress`, commit both.

A slice is done when its commit is an ancestor of the branch this runs on. A slice still on its own branch
is not done — rule 10 says people hold the merge, so the merge is what done means.
