"""Copy the modules both runtimes need from the keel into the toolkit, and refuse a copy that has drifted.

Two things read the logs and the berth allocation. The **keel** does — `slipwai fleet` folds what the logs
hold, `slipwai berth` writes the records — and so does the **toolkit**, inside a generated project, where
the harbourmaster and the captain write every line there is.

A generated project has no slipwai to import. That rule has been learned twice here, and the usual answer is
to move the module to where it runs — which is what slice 5.5b did with `clearance.py`. It does not work for
these two: both runtimes genuinely need them, and a module that lived in only one of them would leave the
other hand-rolling the format, which is how a log reader and a log writer stop agreeing about what a line is.

So there is one source and a generated copy, which is `scripts/glossary.py`'s pattern and
`render-fairways.py`'s: the keel's module is the source, the toolkit's is written from it, and `--check`
refuses one that differs. The copies are byte-identical, so the gate is an equality and there is no template
to get wrong. Both modules import nothing but the standard library, which is what makes that possible and is
the one thing to preserve when either changes — a keel import in one of them breaks the project's copy at the
import line, in a process that has no way to say why.
