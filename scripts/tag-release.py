"""`make release`: assemble the entry, write the version, tag it, and leave nothing to remember.

A release is four things that have to agree: the number in `VERSION`, the entry at the top of
`CHANGELOG.md`, the tag, and the fragments being gone. Doing them by hand means doing three of them and
discovering the fourth from somebody's bug report.

**The number is derived, not typed.** The fragments claim a level each; the entry's level is the highest of
them, and the release is the last one bumped by that. So `1.14.2` with a fix and a new option among its
fragments is `1.15.0`, and nobody has to remember which of the two wins. `--release <version>` overrides it
for the one case arithmetic cannot answer — a `2.0.0` that is a decision rather than a sum.

**Nothing is written until everything can be.** A release that got as far as the tag and then found a
fragment it could not read would leave a tag pointing at a tree whose changelog is wrong, which is a thing
nobody can fix afterwards without rewriting history.

`--check` is the gate: the fragments are readable, each claims a level, and the number they imply is the
one `VERSION` carries. It runs in `make verify`, so a branch that writes a fragment claiming MAJOR and
leaves `VERSION` at a patch is red before it merges rather than at the release.
