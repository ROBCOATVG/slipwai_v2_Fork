"""Fail when the keel's own source stops having the shape it claims.

The generated projects get `scripts/check-imports.py`, which fails a build when domain code names an outer
layer. This is the same idea turned on the keel: the rules below are the architecture, written where they
can be enforced rather than only described, so a module cannot quietly start depending on the command line
or grow back into a second `generate.py`.

Four rules, each with a failure it exists to prevent:

1. **Direction.** Imports point inward, toward the tiers that know less. A part of the generated repository
   may read the selection; the selection may not read a part. Without this, `selection` gains an import of
   `project.makefile` "just to reuse a string" and the thing every module depends on starts depending on
   everything.
2. **No cycles.** Python enforces this at import time, but only for the paths that actually get imported —
   and it reports it as an ImportError from whichever module happened to be first. Checked here, a cycle is
   a named pair before anyone pays for it.
3. **Size.** A module over the budget is the state this package was split out of: a file nobody reads
   end to end, whose contents are found by grep and edited in the dark.
4. **The import surface.** A language package may import only the keel modules `import-surface.txt` lists,
   and that file may list only modules the keel has. Without it, a package leans on a module nobody
   promised it, and a rename inside the keel breaks a language built somewhere this repository cannot see.

The keel knows no package in the other direction either: an absolute import of a `slipwai_language_*`
module anywhere in `src/` is a violation, whichever package it names.

Every module the keel has must be named in TIERS. That is deliberate friction. A module arrives with the
slice that brings it back, and the slice says out loud which tier it belongs to.
