"""Run the guide's first three pages against a freshly generated project, so they cannot drift.

`make test-docs` runs this. It exists because those pages were written from a real session and *still*
shipped six wrong lines — two invented command names, three invented output lines, and a port that was
never bound. Every one of them would have been caught by running the page. So the page is run.

**The gate is a programme, and it reads like the pages.** It generates a project, puts the pages' own model
in it, renders the chart, writes the log lines a captain writes at `BOK-01`'s first stage, and asks the
commands the pages ask, in the order the pages ask them. Each page's commands must appear in exactly the
order the programme has them: a command added to a page, removed from one, or moved is a failure until the
programme is changed with it. That closure rule is the point — a gate that silently covers less than it
claims is the failure this whole file is about.

Each command is checked the strongest way it can be:

  run      The command is run here and every output line the page prints must appear in what it printed.
  capture  It cannot run here — it needs the real chandlery or a different project's run — but
           `docs/captures/` holds its output from a real run (slice 9.3), and the page must match that.
  named    It cannot run and has no capture, so it must print nothing on the page. Its *names* are still
           checked: a make target, a slipwai verb, a script, a `/command` and a skill are held against the
           generation whether they are in a block or in a sentence, because `/speckit-model` — a command
           that has never existed — was written in a sentence.

Nothing about the clock is checked. Two things vary between runs and no page makes a claim about either:
when a line was written, and how long ago. Everything else is compared as written — wildcarding digits
would have let `clearance: 3 of 3` pass against the `1 of 3` this gate found on the page.
