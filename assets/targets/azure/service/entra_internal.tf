# backing-service:keycloak:begin
# Internal identity, provisioned as an Entra ID app registration in the subscription's own workforce tenant:
# the same three groups the local Keycloak realm has, and one confidential client for the services.
# Keycloak stays the local stand-in — same groups, same `OIDC_*` keys — so `make demo` needs no Azure
# subscription and the adapters cannot tell the two apart except by the issuer, which is configuration.
#
# The protocol flow is as unwritten here as it is locally: the redirect URI is a variable with a
# placeholder default because there is no route to redirect to yet. Set it in the environment's tfvars in
# the same change that writes the route.
#
# **App roles rather than security groups**, and that is a deliberate improvement on what a literal
# translation of the Cognito shape would have been. Entra can put group membership in a token, but only as
# the groups' *object ids* — so `OIDC_GROUP_ADMIN` would have had to be a GUID, and creating the groups
# would have needed `Group.ReadWrite.All` on the deploy identity, which is permission over the whole
# directory rather than over this one application. An app role is part of the application object, so it is
# covered by the `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` grant the bootstrap stack makes, it appears in the `roles`
# claim as the plain string below, and the adapter compares the same three names it compares locally.
# `OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM` is `roles` here and `groups` in Keycloak, which is the one line of configuration
# between them — one fewer than Cognito needs.
