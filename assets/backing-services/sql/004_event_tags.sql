-- The tag index: what makes a Dynamic Consistency Boundary expressible over this log.
--
-- A tag is a `kind:value` string — `stream:order-42`, `course:c1` — and an event carries as many as the
-- project's own tagging function returns for it. `stream:<stream_id>` is what it returns by default, which is
-- the same sentence as "stream-per-aggregate is the case where every event carries exactly one tag".
--
-- Three things about this table are deliberate, and each is a decision recorded in the factory's
-- `docs/adr/0001-a-dcb-capable-log.md`:
--
--   1. **It is derived, not authoritative.** The tags of an event are a function of the event, so this table
--      can be emptied and rebuilt at any time — `retag` in the adapter does exactly that. Nothing here is a
--      fact; the facts are all in `events`.
--   2. **`events` is not altered.** No column is added to the log and no history is rewritten, which is what
--      lets a project that is already in production adopt tags at all: 002 installs a trigger that refuses
--      an UPDATE on `events`, so a tag column on the event row could never be backfilled. This table is
--      filled by replaying the log — one INSERT per event, which the trigger has no opinion about.
--   3. **It is written inside the append's transaction.** Never after it. An index that lags the log it
--      indexes would let a conditional append miss the very event that should have refused it, which is the
--      one failure that would make this feature worse than not having it.
CREATE TABLE event_tags (
  tag             TEXT   NOT NULL,
  -- The foreign key is what keeps the index honest: a tag row cannot name an event that does not exist, and
  -- because `events` refuses DELETE it cannot come to name one later either.
  global_position BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES events (global_position),
  PRIMARY KEY (tag, global_position)
);

-- The primary key answers "which events carry this tag", which is the read path. This index answers "which
-- tags does this event carry", which is what a resumable reindex needs to know what it has already done.
CREATE INDEX event_tags_global_position_idx ON event_tags (global_position);
