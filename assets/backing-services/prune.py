"""Prune this project's backing services down to the ones it actually uses.

This file has two lives, deliberately from one copy. The factory imports it to cut a generated project down
to what was selected at generation time, and the generated project carries it as
`scripts/backing-services.py` so `./init` can cut it down further. A second implementation of the same
pruning would be a second set of bugs.

Every question is asked as an **axis** — the role being filled — rather than as a product name:

    scripts/backing-services.py --list
    scripts/backing-services.py --event-store memory     # drop the real store, keep the in-memory one
    scripts/backing-services.py --http none              # drop the inbound HTTP transport
    scripts/backing-services.py --auth none              # drop the internal realm and its adapter
    scripts/backing-services.py --users none             # drop the external realm, the browser login and its adapter

An axis offers only what is still on disk. A project generated with SQLite can drop to memory but cannot
become a Postgres project: pruning only ever subtracts, and the factory already cut the branch it was not
asked for. `--list` shows what each axis can still be answered with in *this* project.

Naming a selection is a one-way prune: it deletes files and strips the markers. Nothing is committed, so
`git checkout .` before your first commit undoes it.

Regions inside a shared file are delimited by `backing-service:<feature>:begin` / `:end` marker comments
rather than parsed out of each host language. A region two features both need — the one Keycloak container
that serves the internal realm and the external one — names both, `backing-service:keycloak|users-keycloak`,
and stays while either remains. That is not laziness: pruning Compose YAML by indentation
looks easy and is not — a two-space key means different things in different sections, `  postgres-data:`
under `volumes:` looks exactly like `  postgres:` under `services:`, and treating it as a service leaves
`volumes:` with nothing under it, which Compose rejects outright. A marker says what the author meant, in
every file, and the author is the only one who knows.

# Every marker feature this script knows how to prune. A feature owns files and marked regions; an axis
# option is answered *with* a set of features. The factory asserts this tuple against its catalog.
# The infrastructure features the keel knows. A feature a language's framework owns — `fastapi`,
# `spring-web` — is not here: it arrives with the option that owns it, in AXIS_OPTIONS below, so this
# list and the catalogue's agree whether or not a package is installed.

# The rows of this project's languages, keyed by the family `project.json` records as each service's
# `language` — per service, since a project's services need not share one. Each family's row says which files
# in a service carry marker regions (`marked_files`), which a feature owns (`owned_files`), what a feature
# added to the service's manifest (`package_edits`) and which uninstaller below takes it away again
# (`manifest`). Paths are relative to the service and may glob.
#
# This script names no language itself: the factory writes the rows of the languages that made the project
# here when it generates it, each language supplying its own, and `slipwai migrate` rewrites them. The copy
# the factory ships as its source has none. A service whose language has no row is refused rather than
# guessed at, since a wrong guess deletes the wrong files.
ROWS: dict[str, dict] = {}

# The axes, and which features each answer keeps. An option is offerable in a given project only when every
# feature it needs is still on disk, which is what makes "you may drop to memory, you may not upgrade to
# Postgres" fall out of the data rather than out of a special case.
#
# `notes` is the consequence of the answer, printed when it is chosen and by `--list`. It is prose rather
# than a doc link on purpose: the moment somebody drops the real event store is the moment they need to be
# told what stopped being provable.
#
# `targets` is where an option is offered — the production targets, as `project.json` records this
# project's under `target`. The factory filtered the menu by it at generation time and this script filters
# the same way afterwards, so an answer a project's target cannot carry is refused here too rather than
# pruned into. SQLite is local-only (the file dies with the task), Keycloak is local-only (Cognito is its
# answer in the cloud), and Cognito is offered under `aws` alone.
#
# `capabilities` is what the answer gives the project — the same list `catalog.json` declares on the option
# and the generator writes into `project.json` per deployable, which is why `record_answers` can swap one
# for another rather than recomputing a project's capabilities from a second copy of the rules. Mirrored
# like `features` and `targets`, and the factory asserts the three agree with the catalog.
# The options a language package brings, written in by the keel when a project is generated, the way
# ROWS is. An option that names a framework — `fastapi`, `spring-web` — belongs to the package that
# implements it, not to the keel: the keel declares the question and the infrastructure answers, and a
# language declares its own. Empty here, and empty in the keel's own copy.
