"""Hold the split's surfaces to what a person actually approved, in both directions.

The mock-up review draws a feature's surfaces, storyboards them, and stops for a person to approve each
state one at a time into `specs/<feature>/mockups/mock-states.md`. The split then says which of those states
each slice delivers. Neither half is worth much without this gate, because both failures are silent.

**A slice that names a state nobody approved** is a slice built against something that was never agreed —
either a `parked` state, which is a question still open, or one that is in the file nowhere at all, which is
one nobody has seen. In version 1 the first sight of a screen was the demo of the slice that built it, and
this is that failure arriving through the split instead.

**An approved state no slice names** is the other direction, and it is the one nobody would otherwise
notice. A person looked at a drawing, said yes to it, and the split quietly did not carry it. Afterwards an
unbuilt surface looks exactly like a surface nobody asked for: there is no error, no gap in the tests, and
nothing to find until somebody goes looking for a thing they remember agreeing to.

**A feature with no surfaces is a written answer**, not an absence. `mock-states.md` holding `surfaces:
none` says the question was asked — a migration, an integration, a scheduled job — and every slice then
leaves the column empty. A feature with no `mock-states.md` at all has not run the stage, which is the
mock-up review rung's business rather than this gate's, so it passes here and says so.
