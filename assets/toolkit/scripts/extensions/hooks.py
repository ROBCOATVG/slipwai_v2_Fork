"""Running an extension's hook at a point, and recording which extensions were elected.

Two jobs, one file, because they are two halves of one fact — which extensions this project elected and what
each of them attached to.

`--elect <key>...` writes `.slipwai/hooks.json` from `available.json` and `available-tools.json`, which the
generator wrote beside this script from the installed packages' manifests. `./init` calls it once, after the
elected extensions have installed themselves. The tool names go in the same file because they follow the
election exactly: unlike a guard, which may refuse a tool call and so is agreed to separately, a tool is
only ever something an extension already there needs the agent allowed to reach. The registry is a controlled file: an iteration that edits it is refused like one that
edits a gate, so a run cannot register a hook on itself.

`<point> [--key value ...]` runs whatever is attached to that point, in extension-name order, each with its
own budget, and **exits 0 whatever any of them did**. A hook is a second belt: the captain's controls — the
last line, the controlled-files diff, the bounded waits, the inbox receipt — all work with every hook
removed. An extension that could fail a stage is an extension that can stop a delivery loop it was added to
help, so what a failing hook produces is a `hook` line naming the extension, the point and the last thing it
printed.

`--fatal` is the one exception, and `make check-extensions` is the only caller that passes it. The `check`
point *is* a gate: an extension that says this project's index is stale is saying the gate should be red, and
a gate that cannot fail is not a gate. The rule it is an exception to is about the rungs of the ladder, which
is where a second control plane would do the damage.

Standalone and dependency-free, like everything else under `scripts/`: this ships inside a generated project,
which has no slipwai to import.
