"""Render `specs/<feature>/chart.yaml` from `docs/event-model/model.yaml`. `make chart` runs this.

On the event-modelling profile the model already answers every question the chart asks. It names each
slice's context and service, types the events each slice produces, and says what each slice reads. So the
chart is not written here, it is *derived* here, and `check-chart` refuses a committed chart that has
drifted from the model — the way `make check-drawio` holds the committed canvas to the same file.

**An event's mark points at the model, and no schema is generated from it.** The model is already the typed
contract on this profile: a frame's `attributes` carry the names, which of them identify something, and a
loose type where the modeller wrote one. Turning that into JSON Schema would mean inventing a mapping from
the model's type words to JSON Schema's, and that mapping would immediately *be* the contract every other
fairway steers by — a type system invented in a renderer, by nobody, holding up everything downstream. So
the mark names `docs/event-model/model.yaml` with the event as its fragment, which is a contract a reader
can open and a gate can check the existence of. The standard profile writes JSON Schema files because it
has no model; this profile has one, which is the whole difference between them.

The chart compares as data rather than as text, so re-rendering with a different YAML writer, or a
reordered model, is not drift. Drift is a fairway, a mark or a slice that says something different.
