"""The rules that read differently by the rung a slice's service is on, and the two that read the same.

A service's **write model** is `events` — the log is the truth and current state is a fold of it — or
`state` — the service keeps current state, and the events the model names are contracts raised after the
write and never replayed. `project.json` records it per deployable as `eventSourced`, and this is the one
place the model gate asks.

**What changes with the rung is the write model, and nothing else.** `chart.py` renders fairways from
`context` and `service`, marks from `evt` frames and steers-by from `reads`, and reads none of `stream`,
`guard`, `folds` or `materialisation` — so the division of work does not know which rung a service is on,
and the rendered chart of a model is the same whichever rung either of its slices is on. Three fields move:

- `stream` is **required** at `planned` on both rungs, and means different things: the stream an append
  carries the expected version of, or the row or aggregate one transaction locks, with its version.
- `guard` and `folds` are **refused by name** on `state`. A guard is a boundary drawn over a tag query and
  a fold is a replay; both need a log, and a slice that names one on a state-stored service is describing
  machinery that service was never given.
- `liveBudget` is **not asked** on `state`. It bounds the fold a `live` state-view does on every query, and
  a service that folds nothing has no such ceiling to name. `materialisation` keeps all three of its words.

`model-matches-code` is unchanged: an event is a file on either rung.

**The two naming rules are not rung rules.** They hold on both, and they are here because this is the
module the gate already reaches for a rule about what a slice says rather than how it is shaped. Each comes
from a Good / Bad / Why table in `skills/event-modeling/references/naming.md`, which is where the reasoning
is written out at length.
