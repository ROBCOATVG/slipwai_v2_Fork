/**
 * Turns the model into Mermaid `eventmodeling` source.
 *
 * ── Four behaviours of the DSL this generator is built around ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Established by rendering probes against mermaid 11.16.1, because none of them are in the documentation
 * and each one is a silent failure rather than an error:
 *
 *   1. Arrows are *inferred* from adjacency in text order. Text order is causal order; the frame number
 *      only decides horizontal position. Two boxes next to each other in the file get an arrow whether
 *      or not you meant one.
 *   2. An explicit `->> n` list *replaces* inference for that box rather than adding to it. So a box with
 *      explicit inputs never also picks up a spurious arrow from whatever precedes it in the file.
 *   3. `rf` (reset frame) breaks inference — and **silently discards any `->>` list given to it**. It
 *      parses and renders with no arrows at all. So a box needing explicit inputs must be `tf`, never `rf`.
 *   4. `title` is a syntax error. The diagram carries no caption; the surrounding page provides it.
 *
 * Which gives the rule this file implements: a slice whose first box has inputs from an earlier slice
 * opens with `tf … ->> n`, and a slice that starts from nothing opens with `rf`. Everything after the
 * first box is `tf`, letting inference draw the chain.
