"""The captain: the outer loop for one fairway, and the thing that believes the log rather than the agent.

`cruise.py` ran one iteration per checkout and trusted what the iteration said about itself. It died at
iteration two, and the seventeen iterations that followed ran from interactive sessions and wrote nothing —
so the checkpoint still said "iteration 2" while twenty slices merged. The inversion this file is built on
falls straight out of that: **a stage that wrote no line made no progress**, and every control here reads
lines rather than asking the thing being controlled how it is getting on.

Each turn it: fetches trunk and both logs; derives the fairway's state from its own `claimed` and `merged`
lines; takes a `fix-trunk` ahead of anything new where the harbourmaster has sent one, because a trunk this
fairway reddened is worth more than any slice it could start; otherwise picks the next slice in split order
that `clearance.py` allows; writes `claimed`; dispatches `/drive`
for that slice in its berth — a headless session of the installed harness, asked for `/drive <slice>
fairway=<name>`; watches the deck log while it runs; reads the inbox at every boundary and
enforces the receipt; asks the harbourmaster for the merge, because a captain holds no credential; and
writes `merged` against the commit the answer names.

**Nothing it relies on is in the agent's answer.** Progress is a new line in the deck log. A stage that has
written nothing for its wall budget is ended and `parked` with the reason — not because the agent said it was
stuck, which a stuck agent cannot say, but because the log stopped.

**And a slice is through its gate only when the log says so, in lines written during this turn.** That rule
was applied to the wall budget and nowhere else, so the first real run had `/drive` print a help message,
exit 0, and this file write `claimed`, then `request: merge`, and report the slice through its gate — with
no `mark-set` and no `demo` anywhere. What closes a slice now is every mark the chart says it `sets`, plus a
`demo`, all after the index this turn started at. *During this turn* is the whole of it: without it a retry
passes on the previous turn's lines, which is the same fault as a cursor that outlives its log.

A demo that came back `behaviour` or `implementation` is not a park, it is a retry. The person who sent it
back is present and has just written notes, and parking would ask them to come back and restart a fairway
before anything acts on them. `/drive` re-enters at the first incomplete stage, so a retry resumes at the
demo rung with the notes in the slice. `attempts` in `harbour.json` bounds it; when it is spent the fairway
parks naming the verdict and the count.

**A hook never costs the rung.** The extension hook points fire around each rung, at each boundary and before
a merge; `hooks.py` always exits 0 for them, and the captain does not read their output. A hook is a second
belt, and a second belt that can stop the run is the thing it was meant to be instead of.

Standalone and dependency-free: this runs inside a generated project, which has no slipwai to import.
