"""The harbourmaster: the one writer of the harbour log, and the only thing in a harbour that holds a credential.

One process per harbour. Its job is two things that both come from the same rule — **one writer per file** —
and a third that comes from a different one.

**It carries between fairways.** A captain writes its own deck log and reads everybody's, but a fairway that
had to read every other fairway's log to find the one line it needed would be reading a hundred files to find
three. So the handful of lines that matter across fairways — a mark set, a park, a berth allocated, a flag
changed — are copied into the harbour log, which has exactly one writer and therefore never conflicts.

**It allocates berths.** A captain asks by writing `berth-request`; the answer is `berth-allocated` in the
harbour log. The numbers are arithmetic (`berths.py`), so nobody chooses one and nobody chooses the same one
twice — but somebody has to decide the order, and one writer deciding it is the whole of the mechanism.

**It holds the credentials, and that is the different rule.** A berth is a sandbox; a berth with a token in
it is a sandbox with a way out. So a captain asks for a push, a merge, a deploy, a flag change or a publish
by writing a `request` line, and this process does it or refuses with the reason. What it will never do is a
closed list, and it is checked against the request's own text rather than trusted to the asker:

    destroy data or history · release what nobody asked for · spend money · expose a secret ·
    weaken security · discard a person's commits · change a gate to make it pass

**Both outcomes are written.** A refusal that left no line is one the captain waits on for ever and nobody
can explain afterwards. That is the same rule as every other log line here: a thing that wrote no line did
not happen.

**And a merge is performed, not just permitted.** For a long while `granted` was written and read by nothing,
no `merged` line was written by anything, and the board said `merged: 0` for ever while slices were being
accepted at their demos. A granted merge now rebases the slice branch onto trunk in a scratch worktree of
this process's own, runs the project's own gate there, and advances trunk — then `granted` carries the
commit, and the captain writes `merged` into its own log against it.

Four things about how, each of which was a choice:

- **One at a time, in the order they were asked.** Each gate then runs on a trunk that already holds every
  merge before it, so a green result is evidence about the trunk the commit will actually land on. Gating
  two in parallel wins nothing, because `make verify` is a whole-repo gate and a result measured against a
  trunk that has since moved has to be measured again.
- **A scratch worktree, never the berth.** The berth belongs to a captain that may still be writing in it,
  and the person's own checkout belongs to the person. `make verify` needs no ports and no Docker — the
  in-memory adapter is what the port's contract runs against — so the scratch worktree needs no berth
  resources and is removed either way.
- **The gate is the project's own `make verify`.** Exactly what the two-gate rule already names, so a
  project that adds a check gets it at the merge for nothing. `make ci` was rejected because it wants
  Docker or the network and a laptop without them could then never merge; a gate narrowed to the changed
  paths was rejected because a narrow gate that passes where `verify` would fail is the worst outcome
  available.
- **A conflict is aborted and refused, naming the paths.** `git rebase --abort`, so nothing is left
  half-done, and the captain resolves in its own berth — where the context is — and asks again. This
  process stays credentials-and-gate only, which matters because it is the one thing here with push rights.

**And trunk's own CI is read before any merge is granted, so the fleet stops adding to a red build.** The
gate above is `make verify`; CI runs `make ci`, which adds `audit` and `test-integration` — so trunk can go
red from a check `verify` never ran, and without this nothing would notice while every fairway kept merging
onto it. A red trunk is harbour-wide rather than one fairway's fault, which is why it is a harbour line and
not just a refusal.

Red refuses every merge and writes `trunk-red` naming the commit and the job; the queue drains the moment
trunk is green again, which is written once as `trunk-green`. A forge this cannot reach reads *could not
verify*, never *green*: the merge still goes ahead — a harbour with no forge has to keep working — and the
`granted` line says the CI was unverified, so nobody reads it later as a run that was checked.

**The fix goes to the captain that broke it, not to a person.** This process wrote the `merged` line for the
commit that went red, so it knows the fairway and the slice: `fix-trunk` names them, and that captain takes
the fix at its next turn ahead of any new slice. A red trunk no `merged` line accounts for — a direct push,
or a red older than any merge — parks for a person at once, because guessing who broke it would send a
captain to rewrite somebody else's work.

Standalone and dependency-free, like everything under `scripts/`: this runs inside a generated project, which
has no slipwai to import. `logs.py` and `berths.py` beside it are the keel's own modules, carried here by
`make shared` and byte-identical to their source.
