"""What the logs say happened to each slice, written where the model's renderers can colour it.

The browsable model already badges every slice with `model.yaml`'s `status` — `proposed`, `modelled`,
`planned`, `implemented`. That field is written by a person at plan time, and it is the field that failed:
MANDA's `model.yaml` said `planned` for eight slices that were built and merged, because nobody went back.

**So the page shows two bands, and this is the second one.** What the model *intends* stays where it is,
written by a person. What *happened* is folded from the deck logs by this, written by nobody. Showing the
two side by side makes the drift visible — a slice badged `implemented` whose log holds nothing is that
same failure, drawn on the page where somebody would see it.

**It writes nowhere near `model.yaml`.** The moment a fold writes back into the field it is folding
against, there is one band again and it is the one that lies. It writes `.slipwai/run-state.json`, which
is ignored by git, and it never touches `model.drawio` either: that file is committed and
`make check-drawio` holds it current, so a heartbeat would dirty the tree on every pass.

**The page works without it.** No run, no file, and the renderers draw exactly what they draw today. This
is an overlay, and an overlay that was required would make the model unrenderable on a fresh checkout.
