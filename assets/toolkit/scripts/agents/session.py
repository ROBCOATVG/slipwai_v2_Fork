"""The harness's own moments, answered by the captain: the guards it refuses at and the hooks it fires.

Every coding harness has a handful of places it will run a command of yours and read what comes back —
before a tool call, before it compacts, when a turn tries to end. Version 1 reached three of them by having
the keel write `scripts/agents/cruise.py <verb>` straight into `.claude/settings.json`, which is how the
control-file refusal came to work on Claude Code and silently nowhere else.

This script is the one place those moments arrive, and it does two things with each: **the keel's own
answer**, and then **whatever an extension declared there**. The second half is the point — the moments are
`guards.py`'s and `hooks.py`'s closed sets, so an extension says `before-write` once and gets it on every
harness that has such an event, rather than learning each harness's spelling.

    python3 scripts/agents/session.py before-write   < the harness's event on stdin
    python3 scripts/agents/session.py before-stop    < the harness's event on stdin

**A guard moment may refuse; a hook moment may not.** `before-write`, `before-command`, `before-fetch`,
`before-search`, `session` and `before-stop` are guards, and this script exits 2 to refuse — the spelling
every harness reads, with the reason on stderr for the model. `before-compact` and `after-compact` are
hooks: they are reported and nothing is refused, because a context is compacted whether an extension liked
it or not.

**The captain depends on none of this.** Its controls are the deck log's own lines, the controlled-files
diff it takes around every stage, the bounded waits and the inbox receipt. Delete this file and the loop
still runs; what is lost is the cheap recovery, not the control. That is the same rule `hooks.py` opens
with, and it is why every failure here is said and shrugged off rather than raised.

Standalone and dependency-free: this ships inside a generated project, which has no slipwai to import.
