"""Which capabilities are whole, which have been accepted, and which are owed a demo.

A **capability** is the chunk of work a person's demo is of: usually several slices, named on the chart, and
the smallest thing that means anything on its own to whoever is being shown it. Version 1 stopped a person
at the end of every slice and showed them a fraction of a capability to assemble in their head.

So the hand still walks a slice's examples at the end of it and records a verdict — a test that passes and a
path that works are different claims, and only one of them is machine-checked — and **nobody is stopped for
it**. The stop a person attends runs when a capability's last slice has merged.

**This is not a release gate.** Accepting a demo says the capability is right. Hoisting a flag says the
business wants it live, which may be another quarter or never, and stays a person's act on their own timing.
A capability may sit accepted and dark for as long as the business wants, so the two are reported here as
separate columns and neither is ever derived from the other. A capability under the `open` release mode has
no flag at all and still has a demo.

    python3 scripts/agents/capabilities.py --due    # only the ones owed a demo now
