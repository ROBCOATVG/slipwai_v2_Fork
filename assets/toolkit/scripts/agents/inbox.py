"""What a fairway owes a person at this boundary: messages unread, decisions unreviewed, waits overrun.

Three rules, and all three exist because the first attempt failed the same way three times: something was
true and nothing said so.

**Messages were documented and not read.** "Read the inbox between stages" was written in command prose, and
under load it did not happen — one of four instructions in MANDA that were documented and all failed. So a
message is answered with a `read` line carrying the `told` line's own timestamp. That is a receipt rather
than an assertion that somebody looked, and a `told` older than its bound with no receipt forces a boundary
rather than waiting for the next one to come round.

**Decisions outran review.** 125 decisions, 105 never read by a person, 8 ADRs still at Proposed. That is
not a record of judgement, it is a backlog of it, and nobody saw it accumulate because nothing counted. So
the count of unreviewed decisions is capped, and over the cap the fairway parks instead of deciding a
126th thing nobody has looked at.

**Waits had no bound.** A run waiting on a mark, a person or a lock looked exactly like a run that had
stopped, which is how seventeen iterations produced no log line and nobody noticed for a fortnight. So
every wait carries a bound and ends as a `parked` line with a reason.

    python3 scripts/agents/inbox.py ORD --forced   # exit 1 where a boundary is owed now
