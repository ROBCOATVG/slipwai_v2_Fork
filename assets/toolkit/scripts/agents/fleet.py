"""Casting off: start the harbourmaster and one captain per fairway, and get out of the way.

`cruise.py` was a runner. It held the state of the run, decided what happened next, and died at iteration
two — after which seventeen iterations ran from interactive sessions and it knew about none of them. The
replacement is not a better runner. It is **no runner**: the state lives in the logs, the captains read them,
and the thing you type starts processes and exits.

That is the whole of this file, and the shortness is the point. Nothing here is in the loop, so nothing here
can be the thing that died.

**One captain per fairway the chart names**, under the telegraph's position — `boilers` is how many may be
lit at once, so the rest wait for a berth rather than all starting and competing for one machine.

**Started detached, and recorded by their pid files.** `--stop` reads them back. A process this started that
is no longer running is said rather than cleaned up quietly: a captain that exited is a fact, and `stop`
pretending it tidied something is how a person stops believing the output.

**The two seat commands are here too, and they read the logs.** `watch` sits and prints every stream's lines
as they are written; `tell` writes one `told` line a stream reads at its next boundary. The runner had both,
reading and writing its own files — a single inbox, a single stream of output, one run's worth of state —
which is exactly what could not survive a second machine. Pointed at the deck logs they need nothing to be
running at all: a `told` written while nothing is lit is read by whatever is lit next.
