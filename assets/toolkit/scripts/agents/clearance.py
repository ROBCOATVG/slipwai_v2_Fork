"""What may start now: the chart's marks against the deck logs' `mark-set` lines.

Version 1's rule was "its own contract is settled", which a slice could only answer about itself. That
serialised a fresh fairway, because nothing said what a slice was waiting *for*. Issue #32 asked for this
one: a slice has clearance when every mark it steers by has been set, and a mark is set when some slice
wrote a `mark-set` line for it at its own first stage, in its own worktree.

So a sibling unblocks this slice by having **planned**, not by having merged. That is the whole of the
parallelism version 2 promises. If a merge were the signal, every fairway would wait on every other one.

**State comes from the log and never from a status field.** In the first attempt `model.yaml` said `planned`
for eight slices that were built and merged, because the field was written at plan time and never
reconciled. A log line is written by the thing that did the work at the moment it did it.

This lives in the toolkit rather than in the keel because the things that ask it — a `/drive` session, and
the captain — run inside a generated project, which has no slipwai to import. That is the same reason
`check-chart` and `check-slice-scope` are scripts. The first version of this was a keel module, and it was
unreachable from everything that needed it.

    python3 scripts/agents/clearance.py            # every slice that may start now
    python3 scripts/agents/clearance.py BIL-01     # whether that one may, and what it waits on
