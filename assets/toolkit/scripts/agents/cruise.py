"""`/cruise`'s settings: what a run does at each of the ladder's stops, read and changed in one place.

This was a runner. It held the state of a run, decided what happened next, re-invoked the ladder in a fresh
session each time — and died at iteration two, after which seventeen iterations ran from interactive sessions
and it knew about none of them. What replaced it is not a better runner but **no runner**: the state lives in
the append-only logs, a captain per stream reads them, and `scripts/agents/fleet.py` starts those captains and
exits. Nothing holds a run, so nothing can be the thing that died.

What is left here is the settings, which outlived the loop because they were never the loop's: they are the
answers a run gives at `/sail`'s stops — who decides a product question, what a release becomes, what a demo
is driven with, what an unratified constitution does, what a block becomes. A captain reads this file; so does
`/sail` under one. The shape is `sail.py`'s, which does the same job for the ladder's own settings.

    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py                       # every setting and what it controls
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py --check               # well-formed; `make check-agents` runs this
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py --set enabled=true    # change settings, checked, any time

Where the runner's verbs went, each to the thing that owns it now:

| was | is |
|---|---|
| `run`, `start`, `stop`, `status` | `scripts/agents/fleet.py start`, `stop`, `list` |
| `watch` | `scripts/agents/fleet.py watch` — the deck logs, not one runner's output |
| `tell`, `told` | `scripts/agents/fleet.py tell <stream>`, and `scripts/agents/inbox.py <stream>` |
| `guard`, `stopping` | the `before-write` and `before-stop` guards, `scripts/agents/session.py` |
| `compacting`, `resume` | the `before-compact` and `after-compact` hooks, same script |
| `loop`, `denials`, `where` | gone: there is no outer loop to report, and `slipwai fleet` is where a run stands |

Standalone and dependency-free: this ships inside a generated project, which has no slipwai to import.
